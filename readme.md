# Web Search Engine

## Overview
In this Project I am building a web search
engine which will give the relevant top
50(default) website links depending on the
query and that will be ordered on the basis
of their relevance. For this started crawling
all the websites which are in uic domain and
collected around 3K website and its content.
After that we have generated the TF-IDF
vector out of the text contained in the
collected website. for finding the top most
relevant document we have fetched the
documents which has maximum similarity
with the query. For arranging the documents
in the order used the page rank algorithm
which gives the rank to page according to
its linkage with the other pages.
