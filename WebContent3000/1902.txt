We hope all interested students continue to take precautions to remain safe and healthy. We'll see you in Summer 2021!  As Chicagoâs only public school, UIC John Marshall is committed to promoting diversity in the legal profession and providing access and opportunity to all people interested in pursuing the study of law, but we know the transition from undergrad to law school can feel a bit overwhelming. With that in mind, we created the Summer Pre-Law Program for Undergraduates (PLAW) to make law school a realistic possibility for all students, especially students from historically underrepresented communities who might not have considered a career in law.       About PLAW   Open to rising sophomores and junior majoring in any subject from any college or university, PLAW will:   Introduce you to the role lawyers play in society.  Expose you to the study of law and how lawyers think and write.  Guide you on how to effectively prepare for the LSAT, the law school entrance exam.  Provide you with role models and potential mentors to guide you through the law-school application process and beyond.  Prepare you to present a strong law school application for admission.        Additional Details     Enrollment   Students interested in PLAW must submit a pre-admission questionnaire.Â  Once your questionnaire is reviewed, you’ll be contacted for a short interview (in person or via SKYPE). Upon acceptance into the program, you’ll be provided registration information. All rising sophomore and juniors from any college or university are welcomed in PLAW, regardless of undergraduate major.  Download the Pre-admission Questionnaire     Registration Fees   The cost to attend PLAW is just the tuition and fees for the two courses. All course materials are provided for free. Note that financial aid, including Pell grant funds, may be available. Please consult your home undergraduate institution with any questions about financial aid.

These are both three-credit, graded courses that have been approved for credit by UIC.Â  Students at UIC and other undergraduate institutions should check with their undergraduate departments to see if these courses count toward their undergraduate elective requirements.      Survey of American Law (3 Credits)         Course Information   Course Credit : 3 Credits  Prerequisites : Must be taken concurrently with Legal Analysis & Communication .  Instructor : Professor Sonia Bychkov Green  Survey of American Law provides an overview of substantive legal issues and what itâs like to study law as a law student. Taught by a law professor, this course is geared toward students who may not have had any exposure to legal topics and provides an introduction to topics from a legal perspective.  The goal of the course is to make the topics interesting and relevant, to engage the students in conversation, and to spark their curiosity about the varied aspects of the U.S. legal system. The course includes some lectures; however, it also includes group discussions, group projects, and a variety of interactive components. Course readings include cases, statutes, and short legal articles and newspaper articles about various legal topics. Students will discuss how these topics are relevant to them and how they impact their communities. Students will also experience how attorneys develop hypothetical legal scenarios by creating and answering legal questions.  Course materials are provided for free, either electronically or as handouts.  This is three-credit, graded course has been approved for credit by UIC. Students at UIC and other undergraduate institutions should check with their undergraduate departments to see if these courses count toward their undergraduate elective requirements.        Legal Analysis & Communication (3 Credits)         Course Details   Course Credit : 3 Credits  Prerequisites : Must be taken concurrently with Survey of American Law .  Instructor : Assistant Dean Tania A. Luma  Legal Analysis & Communication simulates various types of work performed by attorneys, especially junior attorneys. Students prepare to act as a junior attorney representing a client under the supervision of a senior attorney (the legal writing professor). The course centers around a client problem. Students begin by interviewing a client to hone their listening and critical thinking skills. Students then conduct a client interview to unravel the client’s injury and relevant facts. From there, the senior attorney will debrief and further develop the relevant issues within the client problem.  As students navigate the client problem over the four-week course, they examine a body of case law to develop reading comprehension, logic and analytical reasoning, and problem-solving skills. Students participate in comprehensive writing by completing objective and persuasive legal memorandums. Students continually absorb relevant case law in their reading and apply legal analysis to provide objective conclusions while preparing arguments for possible solutions.  Students engage in evaluating their mindset and non-cognitive approach to their work. An appropriate mindset is critical to sustained, high-academic performance. The legal writing professor will also set aside time to meet 1:1 at least once during the course to give individual feedback and engage in dialogue about the course in the context of each student’s needs.  Course materials are provided for free, either electronically or as handouts.  This is three-credit, graded course has been approved for credit by UIC. Students at UIC and other undergraduate institutions should check with their undergraduate departments to see if these courses count toward their undergraduate elective requirements.
