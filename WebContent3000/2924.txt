The program is led by the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at UIC and sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Â Program partners include Chicago Public Schools high schools â Lincoln Park High School, North-Grand High School, and Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy, and two community colleges â Moraine Valley Community College and Prairie State College.  The Chicago Geopaths program is working to build relationships between regional high schools, community colleges, and UIC to strengthen the exposure that Chicago area students have to geoscience and the relevance of geoscience to their urban-world view. Our aim is to increase student interest in geoscience, encourage their selection of geoscience as a college major, and support their entry into the geoscience workforce.           For High School Students   Chicago area high school students can participate in Chicago Geopaths in multiple ways.Â  We currently offer a 2 credit hour dual-enrollment course (taken at UIC for college credit), entitled “Climate, Contamination, and Chicago.”Â  Additionally, students can work with faculty and peer mentors, who can assist them in exploring their geoscience interests, guide them through the college application process, and support their academic progress.        For High School Students        Dual-Enrollment Course  2 credit hour, general education course held on the UIC campus during the Spring semester          Mentoring  Faculty and peer mentors are available to students interested in the geosciences             For Community College Students   Students at local community colleges can participate in Chicago Geopaths through our Guided Course Pathways and UIC’s Transfer Admission Guarantee program. As students become more interested in geoscience and attending UIC, they can follow the Guided Course Pathways so that they can work to complete their Associate and Baccalaureate degrees in a time-efficient manner.Â  Faculty and peer mentors will also be available to students to help them explore their geoscience interests, guide them through the college application process, and support their academic progress.
