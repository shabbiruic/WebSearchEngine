A: MESA stands for measurement, evaluation, statistics, and assessment.   Measurement involves the assignment of numbers to objects such that the numbers represent degrees or quantities of unobservable constructs such as attitudes, achievement, self-efficacy, self-esteem, etc.  Evaluation involves the systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs to make judgments about program quality, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future program development.  Statistics aims at learning the process that generated the data, including learning how a given variable is affected by other variables, and learning about the true (population) distribution of the data.  Assessment involves the processes of collecting, synthesizing, analyzing, and interpreting quantitative and qualitative information to aid in decision-making.   Q: What are the job prospects? A: Surveys of degree programs and employment agencies conclude that there is high demand for quantitative and qualitative methodologists who can function effectively in research and applied settings. The MEd program is designed to prepare individuals for careers working in a variety of research and applied settings, such as academic institutions, state and federal agencies, school districts, research consulting firms, the testing industry, and evaluation organizations (e.g., licensure and certification boards, private and not-for-profit testing organizations).  Q: I noticed that there are two MESA MEd programs at UIC: on-campus MESA MEd and online MESA MEd. What are their differences and similarities?  A: The two programs are similar in the following major dimensions: (a) Admission criteria: They require the same application materials and admit students by using the same criterion; (b) Degree requirements: They both require 32 credit hours (typically students take eight 4-credit courses or courses with other credit hours to reach 32); (c) Diplomas: The MEd diplomas for the two programs are the same.  The two programs differ in the following major dimensions: (a) Delivery of the courses: All the courses for the online MESA MEd program are delivered online. Courses for the on-campus MESA MEd programs are mixed--some of them are online and some of them are on campus. (b) Tuition: The campus and online tuition rates are different. View tuition information for a specific term/year.  Q: What are the courses offered in your program?  A: We typically offer the following MESA related courses. Besides those courses, MESA MEd students can also take other MESA related courses inside and outside the College of Education to meet their MESA MEd degree requirement with the program coordinator's approval.
