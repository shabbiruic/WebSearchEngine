Students entering the PhD program in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics will take courses in the GEMS curriculum during the first year. This curriculum will provide students with a broad background in biochemistry, molecular genetics, and other biomedical sciences. In the second year and beyond, students will pursue their own specific scientific interests by taking a variety of advanced courses and by undertaking a research program under the mentorship of a departmental faculty member whom they have selected during their first-year research rotations.  The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics also participates in the Medical Scientist Training Program . The department has active, well-funded research programs in the molecular biology of growth and development, oncogenesis, metabolic regulation, macromolecular structure and function, signal transduction, and the biochemical basis of diseases. The Interdepartmental Concentration in Neuroscience and the Interdepartmental Concentration in Cardiovascular Science are available to doctoral students.
