Urban Studies majors can pursue the minor, but they cannot apply US 130 to both the major and the minor. As a result, the course can be replaced with one of the 300-or 400-level courses in the selective lists above. 2 Urban Studies majors who pursue the minor will take US 230 to fulfill the requirements of the minor, and the course cannot be used as a selective for the major.
