Services for graduate students include resources and assistance in targeting, applying for, and managing funding. We work closely with departments to help with student funding questions. The Fellowship Coordinator serves as the official UIC contact for a number of external fellowships and funding agencies as well.  For further information, please review the Graduate Funding OverviewÂ section of the UIC Graduate College website.  If you are seeking to verify a medical fellow or medical residency, please contact the Office of Graduate Medical Education in the College of Medicine.
