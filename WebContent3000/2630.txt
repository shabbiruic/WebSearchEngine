Reasonable accommodations are academic adjustments, reasonable modifications, and auxiliary aids and services. Determinations about requests for accommodations are made in an individualized manner based on the nature of the disability and the academic environment. Reasonable accommodations provide equal access to educational programs and activities, not an unfair advantage.
