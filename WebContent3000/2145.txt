His research focuses on: (a) the development and evaluation of mHealth technologies and interventions for self-management of chronic diseases and other health conditions; (b) the conduct of comparative effectiveness reviews of telehealth and mHealth interventions; and (c) the development of methods and guidelines to enhance the scientific rigor and consistency of evidence synthesis reviews. With a particular interest in primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease, Dr. Kitsiou's overarching research goal is to make a difference in peopleâs lives through the development of novel and contextually appropriate mHealth apps, interventions, and evidence synthesis reports that target health outcomes and problems of significance to communities, governments, and health agencies. Dr. Kitsiou is the founder and director of the mHealth Innovation Lab at UIC, and Associate Editor in two top-ranked health informatics journals, namely the Journal of Medical Internet Research and JMIR mHealth and uHealth.
