CUPPA faculty, students, and staff design and implement multi-disciplinary scholarship using knowledge, tools, resources and talents drawn from the domains of education, research, and service. The collaboration adds value to more routine activities within each domain. For example, classroom learning is enlivened by new research and practical case studies, research reports inform relevant policy discussions, and collaboration with partners gives access to excellence for those outside the university.  Our engagement with the community includes research that aids in policy solutions for such issues as helping people with disabilities find appropriateÂ housing; creating better transportation options for areas lacking access to jobs, parks, and shopping; helping law enforcement with community policing and problem solving; and providing crucial information to citizens about their government and services.  Our research is funded by renowned foundations such as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Woods Fund, the Robert R. McCormick Foundation, Ford Foundation,Â Rockefeller Foundation and Chicago Community Trust, as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Department of Justice.
