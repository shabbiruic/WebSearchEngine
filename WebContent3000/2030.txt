It borrows from other disciplines such as Biology, Psychology, Philosophy and Chemistry.  Majoring in Neuroscience presents you with core knowledge from other majors, thus our students graduate with an appreciation for how the nervous system develops, is organized, and communicates in the service of behavior. An understanding of how the nervous system functions is dependent on ever-developing technology. Neuroscience majors will thus have the opportunity to witness innovation through laboratory courses and undergraduate research experiences.
