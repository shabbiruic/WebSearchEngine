Create strategies for addressing the issues impacting Arab American lives  Foster relationships between faculty, students, and Arab American communities        History   Founded in 2016 by UIC faculty and staff, the Arab American Cultural Center grew out of the Arab and Muslim American Community Network (AMAC), which was established three years prior. The ArabAmCC is the first cultural center serving Arab Americans on a college campus in the United States.
