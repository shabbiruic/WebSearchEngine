Midwest Roybal Center  Tobacconomics   News              The Universityâs Research Mission Is Our Mission      The Institute for Health Research and Policy is a home and incubator of UIC research spanning the social and health sciences to advance health, overall well-being, and quality of life.  The Institute fosters and supports new research ideas and collaborations to address pressing social and health challenges facing us today.  Research at the Institute recognizes that multiple factors contribute to a person’s health and well-being across the lifespan:   Individual differences in biology, psychosocial factors, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors;  Contextual influences of family, social networks, school, religious community, organizational membership and neighborhood;  Social, cultural and environmental influences, including racism, historical experience, the built environment, and environmental exposures.   Understanding and addressing these factors often requires an integration of multiple disciplines, methods and research approaches to advance solutions to the health and social problems facing us today. The Institute provides UIC scientists a unique research environment and resources to nurture such complex studies.  The Institute is more than a place that administers individual grants.  IHRP draws together intellectual energy and creativity from across the University of Illinois at Chicago to help faculty-scientists thrive, develop collaborations, and catalyze new research endeavors while advancing the social and health sciences.  In this way, the Institute fosters research success for the University as a whole.  Learn more about research at IHRP .
