Comparative and diverse developmental perspectives illuminate linkages among the countries and peoples of the Americas. A major or minor in Latin American and Latino Studies can serve as a useful basis for careers in public service, business, professional, or academic life related to Latin America or U.S. Latinos.  Requirements are designed so that students acquire a general background in both Latin American and Latino studies in the lower-division courses. Students have the option to pursue a general curriculum by taking an equal amount of upper-division courses in Latin American and Latino Studies or to pursue an area of specialization in either Latin American or Latino Studies by taking more upper-division courses in one of the two areas. Students may also choose to take courses in a particular disciplinary area of the humanities (history and cultural studies) or the social sciences (anthropology, political science, sociology) or a combination of these areas. Students are strongly encouraged to take at least one course on Mexico.
