Two themes run through this work: structure-function relationships of key synaptic molecules, such as receptors and transporters, and the functional modulation of synapses.

Paul Malchow  Janet Richmond          Systems and Circuits         Systems and Circuits   Sensory processing and motor programming are being analyzed in the labs. The theme in this cluster is understanding how information about the world is encoded within the central nervous system and finally how central information is decoded to generate organismal behavior.

Â Marya Schechtman Â researches personal identity, practical reason, and our conception of the self.  David Hilbert  Marya SchechtmanÂ             Naked mole-rats turn into plants when oxygen is low, Dr. Thomas Park      Deprived of oxygen, naked mole-rats survive by turning into plants, metabolically â a finding that may yield discoveries for heart attack and stroke treatments.
