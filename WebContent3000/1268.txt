Graduates of the program will be able to use research skills and knowledge in their career to improve health outcomes for a variety of populations.  The College of Dentistry also offers a program of study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy in Oral Sciences to train the next generationâs cadre of oral health scientists. Oral Sciences utilizes cutting-edge biomedical technology and knowledge to address basic and clinical research questions of importance for promoting and maintaining oral health. This interdisciplinary research training program will lead to a graduate degree with a focus in cancer biology; wound healing; tissue regeneration; cellular, molecular, and development biology; biomaterials science; microbiology/immunology or other biomedical field relevant to oral health and disease. The program also offers an opportunity to integrate the PhD training with a DMD or dental specialty training, as well as subsequent to a BS or DMD degree.
