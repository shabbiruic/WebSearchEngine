The primary objectives of the program are to provide students with strong grounding in research and theory concerning the cognitive, social, emotional, moral and physical development of youth, as well as knowledge of contextual and institutional factors that lead to positive developmental outcomes for youth.  The program has two primary strands:   an Applied Strand aimed at producing high quality professionals to work within the field of youth development  a Thesis Strand aimed at providing students planning to seek doctoral degrees in Educational Psychology, as well as other fields, with preparatory training and background in developmental theory, research methods, and statistics   The curricular difference between these two strands lies in the Culminating Experience. Applied students do two semesters of fieldwork from which they build a professional practice portfolio. Students in the thesis strand spend their last two semesters conducting research and writing their thesis with a thesis advisor.
