Begin Honing Your Craft Now.       Writing Resource Center      UIC John Marshall Law Schoolâs Writing Resource Center (“Writing Resource Center” or “Center”) provides supplemental writing support to currently enrolled students. The Center accomplishes this goal by providing two primary services:   Writing Workshops : The Center offers interactive group workshops on a variety of legal writing topics. Refer to our 1L and 2L/3L services to learn more about specific workshops.  One-on-One Coaching Sessions : Each staff member of the Writing Resource Center meets with students in one-on-one conferences, tailoring assistance to each student’s needs.   Becoming a lawyer means becoming a professional writer; however, the writing process is not just about drafting legal documents. It comprises a series of steps that include critical reading, understanding, and clear communication. Mastering the writing process is relevant not just to law school, but to the legal profession.  Significantly, the Writing Resource Center supports students in a holistic manner. Because legal writing is an interconnected skill, the Center collaborates and coordinates with the Lawyering Skills Program, Academic Achievement, Career Services, and other law school departments.
