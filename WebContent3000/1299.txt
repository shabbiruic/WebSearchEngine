All students should contact the MS CTS Program Coordinator who will explain the application process for MS CTS admission.  Acceptance into the DMD/MS CTS Joint Degree Program requires approval by the DMD/MS CTS Joint Degree Committee. For students applying to both programs simultaneously, MS CTS admission will be contingent upon both admission to the DMD program and the support of the College of Dentistry director of graduate studies. Prior to admitting students into the MS CTS, HPA will check with COD to determine whether the student has been accepted into the DMD program.  Admission to the MS CTS program will be determined based on the support of the College of Dentistry director of graduate studies, previous academic achievement, research potential, commitment to CTS as evidenced by prior participation in clinical research, and two letters of recommendation. Students already enrolled at the College of Dentistry are to contact the director of graduate studies for further information. A DMD student must apply to the MS CTS by May 1 of the D1 year, so that the student may enroll in MS course work during the fall of what would be the D2 year.  Letters of recommendation Two required. One must be from a suitable clinical researcher who can attest to the applicantâs research abilities. Both letters of recommendation should address:  the applicantâs previous achievements in research and/or academics;  the applicantâs potential for successfully completing a clinical/translational research project;  analysis of the applicantâs career plans and commitment to research, and  how the joint degree would advance these plans.    Personal Statement Applicants will also submit a personal statement detailing accomplishments to date, and career goals and plans. Specifically, applicants should address background information relevant to their interest in clinical and translational research, and how additional training through the DMD/MS CTS program would help achieve these goals. The applicant should provide any prior or ongoing research experience and explain how this might interface with the joint degree program.   Degree Requirements  In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, students must meet the following program requirements:   The DMD/MS CTS is a five-year program. Students in the program must satisfy the requirements of the MS CTS, a 48 semester hour program, and satisfy four years of the required DMD program.  For the College of Dentistry, the student must require no remediation or repetition of D1, D2, or D3 courses and must maintain a minimum grade point average required by the Collegeâs Executive Committee on Student Promotions. Failure to maintain the accepted standard of academic excellence in the College of Dentistry will lead to dismissal from the joint program.  For the MS CTS, the student must adhere to all relevant Graduate College policies, including minimum GPA and limits on transfer credit.  Minimum Semester Hours Required Students in the program must satisfy requirements of the Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Science, a 48 semester hour program, and satisfy four years of the required Doctor of Dental Medicine Degree program of study.  D1 Yearâ(39 credit hours in the DMD program), plus MS CTS workshops and seminars.  D2 Yearâ(59 credit hours in the DMD program), plus MS CTS workshops and seminars.  D3 Yearâ(60 credit hours in the DMD program) with opportunity for shared hours, plus MS CTS workshops and seminars. With proper planning and prior approval by the executive associate dean for academic affairs at the College of Dentistry, joint degree students may apply up to 4 hours of IPHSÂ 598 toward clinical rotation requirements.  D4 Yearâ(54 credit hours in the DMD program) with opportunity for shared hours, plus MS CTS workshops and seminars. With proper planning and prior approval by the executive associate dean for academic affairs at the College of Dentistry, joint degree students may apply up to 4 hours of IPHSÂ 598 toward clinical rotation requirements (community service component).
