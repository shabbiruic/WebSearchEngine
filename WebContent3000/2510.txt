The Pharmacoepidemiology certificate course schedule follows theÂ Academic Calendar Â set forth by the University of Illinois at Chicago. Courses are offered in the fall and spring semesters.  How do the certificate online courses work?  All certificate courses are delivered entirely online and rely on asynchronous discussion and collaboration as the principle form of communication. Via a Web-based system ( Blackboard ) class members interact extensively with one another and the instructor. Students participate anytime day or night, when their schedules allow, while still meeting due dates for assignments. There are no required campus visits.  When should I log in to the courses?  There are no specific times or days of the week students must log in; however, students are expected to complete assignments by the due dates specified in the course syllabus. Students are encouraged to log intoÂ BlackboardÂ at least four times per week to stay on track.  How much time should I expect to spend on courses?  Students should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per week on course related activities. Many readings can be downloaded and/or printed, so actual online time is much less.  How long does it take to complete the certificate program?  This certificate can be earned in approximately two semesters (two courses each in the fall and spring semester) or four semesters (one course per semester).  When do I need to apply to the certificate program?  See theÂ Admissions Â page of our Web site for application deadlines.  What is the tuition for the Pharmacoepidemiology certificate program?  Online programs are assessed the UIC e-Tuition, which is a single-rate, per credit hour tuition. See theÂ Tuition and Fees Â page of our Web site for current tuition information. NOTE: Tuition and fees are subject to change without notice any time prior to the first day of instruction.  Do I have to take the GRE?  Matriculation into the Pharmacoepidemiology certificate program does not require a GRE score from potential students.  When will I earn my certificate?  Certificate students must complete the four certificate courses and maintain a 3.00 (out of 4.00) cumulative grade point average to earn the Campus Certificate in Pharmacoepidemiology.
