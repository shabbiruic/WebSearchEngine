Embodied Inequality Series: Unpacking the Impact of Race & Racism on Health  Building on important work that has documented extensive health disparities, this interdisciplinary lecture series explores why race is so consequential for health outcomes. Sessions focus on a range of topics including how race matters for access to healthcare and healthcare delivery, how structural and interpersonal racism impact mental, emotional and physical health, and how scholars, practitioners, and community groups can intervene to improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities.   Legacies of Racism Series  Events in the Legacies of Racism series deepen our understanding of the challenges and possibilities of policy efforts to address longstanding racial inequality. These events explore the recent and historic origins of inequalities and ask questions about what it means to try to repair systematic harm done to people and communities.     State of Racial Justice in Chicago Project  The State of Racial Justice in Chicago Project provides a comprehensive picture of the inequities and changing conditions that racial and ethnic groups in Chicago face in the last half century. Events, presentations, and reports produced in conjunction with this project provide accessible data and analysis on how racial and ethnic groups in Chicago are faring in relation to housing, economics, education, justice, and health and are meant as a resource for the development of new engaged research projects and policy solutions.

Policy 101 Workshops  A collaboration with the Institute of Government and Policy and the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement, Policy 101 Workshops provide UIC faculty and graduate students with focused trainings that increase their ability to participate in public policy conversations and increase the impact and visibility of UIC scholarsâ research. The workshops are taught by professionals and academics who are experts at translating academic research into policy-ready documents, policy presentations and civic engagement and are offered approximately bi-annually on a rotating basis.   Race⁄Ethnicity Workshop  In collaboration with the UIC Office of Diversity, this is an interdisciplinary monthly workshop of new and in-progress cutting edge research on race/ethnicity and public policy. The workshop brings together faculty and advanced graduate students with specializations in race/ethnicity and public policy from UIC and other area universities.   Faculty Development Program   The Faculty Development Program supports UIC faculty who are doing research on race/ethnicity that has the potential to contribute to policy conversations and actions. This program provides funding designed to help faculty access the time and resources they need for research and to stimulate and support new community engagement. In addition to material support, the Faculty Development Program provides mentoring resources and creates community amongst faculty through three components: Engaged Research Support (e.g., individual meetings and training workshops on working with community partners); Writing Support (e.g., twice yearly week-long writing retreats); and Community Building (e.g., cohort events).   WriteOut!   WriteOut! is a week-long writing retreat for UIC doctoral students or UIC faculty from all disciplines who study race and/or ethnicity. The retreat includes a light breakfast, a daily accountability meeting with a writing coach, printing and copying, workshops to further your writing practice, and is free to those who complete the retreat.
