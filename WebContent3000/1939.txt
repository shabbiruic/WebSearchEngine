In a series of three photography collections, entitled, âKoktel,â (Haitian Creole for âcocktailâ), âPariah,â and âImperiumâ, Zevallos wrestles with themes of Black masculinity, turbulent and contested, in the Caribbean and beyond.  Zevallos interpretive photography boldly defies racist stereotypes of Black men as hyper-masculine, violent and uncaring. Dealing with themes of angst, incarceration, love, hetero-patriarchy, brotherhood, beauty and resilience, Zevallosâ images invite viewers to transcend constructs that promote toxic masculinities, and to rethink the ways in which we see race, gender, sexuality and our collective humanity.  While the images are beautiful and powerful, they are not meant to be celebratory. âReimagining Black Masculinityâ invites viewers to interrogate the stereotypes that endanger and constrain Black men, as well as the toxic masculinist expressions and violent actions that also endanger Black women and femmes in our communities.
