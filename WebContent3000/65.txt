Chicago fundamentals      Brush up on these facts about the unique flavor, history and sites of Chicago. With this information you mayÂ win a few trivia contests and sound like a lifelong Chicagoan.             What makes it Chicago-style?   Chicago is a great food city, and some of our distinctÂ flavor comes from Chicago-style pizza and hot dogs.Â Our deep-dishÂ pizza is unique because of its height andÂ the order of its ingredients: the pizza is covered in cheese then smothered in tomato sauce. Chicago hot dogs sit on aÂ poppy-seed bun covered with mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle spear, pickled peppers and celery salt — and most importantly: no ketchup!    Dining in Chicago                  Architecture   Chicago is home to the very first skyscraper. The Home Insurance Building was built in 1885Â by William Le Baron Jenney. The Willis (Sears) Tower is present-day Chicagoâs largest skyscraper. Built in 1970, the shape was named as the âbundle tube structureâ and is famous for its two antennas. See all of Chicago’sÂ great architecture via the manyÂ walking and bus tours as well as boat tours on the Chicago River during the warmer months. To see the cityÂ from above, check out the observation decks atÂ Willis Tower Â orÂ the Hancock Building .    Chicago Architecture Foundation                  The Chicago Fire   Legend saysÂ theÂ Great Chicago FireÂ ofÂ 1871 was started by a cow kickingÂ over a lantern. It’s real cause unknown, the fireÂ destroyed three-and-a-half square miles of the city. The Chicago Water Tower was one of the few buildings to surviveÂ and still stands today along the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago. The re-built ChicagoÂ included fireproof buildings and the first skyscraper made of steel, introducing the city to the industrial revolution.    More Chicago history                  The Loop   Most Chicagoans know the Loop to be the rectangular ring of elevated train tracks in the central business district, but some say that the nameÂ first referred toÂ the downtown cable car turning loops. The officially designated community areaÂ namedÂ the Loop, however, expands beyond the “L” train hub. It stretches from Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and south to Roosevelt Road. Inside the Loop you’ll findÂ City Hall, MillenniumÂ Park, Chicago Board of Trade, shopping on State Street, great restaurants and a variety of cultural and civic attractions.    Explore the Loop                  The Lakefront/Burnham Plan   In 1909, Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett created the Plan of Chicago Â after studying cities across the world.Â The commonly-called Burnham Plan was created to improve the city so that it could better serve its growing population. One of the biggest goals of the plan was to improve and increase access to Chicago’s lakefront. Other elementsÂ included developing civic and cultural centers, larger streets, railroads and a highway system. It also introduced the grid system to the city.    Digital essay on the Plan of Chicago                  Second City   Although Chicago is now the third largest city in the U.S., it was second only to New York for nearly 100 years in the aftermath ofÂ the 1871 fire. Some say the nickname Second City first came fromÂ New Yorker magazine writer Abbott J. Liebling’s less-than-flattering bookÂ Chicago: The Second City . However, othersÂ say it arose like the city from the ashes of the great fire when the “second city” of Chicago was built. Whatever the origins, today you’re more likely to hear it called Chi-Town, the Windy City or Sweet Home Chicago.
