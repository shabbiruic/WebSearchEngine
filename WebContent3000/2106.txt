Â Our Doctor of Public Health in Leadership (DrPH) degree program is among the largest such programs in the world, due in large part to the efforts of Dr. Patrick Lenihan, who was director of the program until his retirement in 2019.  The magazine profiles the schoolâs Institute for Health Research and Policy, as well as the work around community engagement, including plans to launch a new Center for Engaging for Health Equity and Action.
