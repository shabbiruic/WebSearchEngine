Housed in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, this master's degree allows students the autonomy to pursue areas of study (and related coursework) that most align to their personal and professional aspirations. In this way, when an opportunity arises, a graduate will have credentials to pursue it.       Customization and Flexibility   Of the 32 semester hours required for the degree, nine hours are required courses (these are ED 402, ED421, and ED430). Students can design their own courses of study for the other semester hours. 14 of the hours need to be offered within the College of Education (400 or 500 level) and the 9 elective hours can be courses offered in the College of Education or in another UIC college. 9 hours need to be at the 500 level (which helps lay a foundation for potential doctoral work in the future).  Educational Studies offers a high degree of flexibility in creating a course of study that most aligns to an individualâs past experiences as well as to his or her future plans. Many of our graduates advance their careers in areas such as   ESL/Bilingual work  Curriculum writing and publishing  Museum education  Community engagement  Curriculum theory  Research or doctoral studies        Questions about the program?
