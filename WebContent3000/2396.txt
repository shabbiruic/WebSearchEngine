They represent an important member of the multidisciplinary team of scientists who study behavioral, environmental, infectious, nutritional and/or genetic contributions to the disease. The concentration in Cancer Epidemiology provides curriculum guidance to those students who are interested in the field.Â  TheÂ concentration is intended to provide specialized training to enable MS students: to describe and characterize the major known determinants of cancer; to describe, locate, analyze and interpret existing data relevant to cancer; and understand the strengths and weaknesses of alternative epidemiologic study designs in the context of cancer research.
