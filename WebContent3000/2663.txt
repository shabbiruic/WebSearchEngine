Over the years, we have served over 35000Â high school students and helped them realize their academic potential by successfully placing over 95% of our graduates in colleges and universities across the country and in the State of Illinois.  The Upward Bound program at UIC is designed to educate students to use the art of critical thinking, effective expression and a positive attitude so that they are able to negotiate the pursuit of higher education and a more satisfying future.  The program maintains an atmosphere of creativity and achievement where students become excited about learning. The opportunities to think, listen, learn and grow in step with each studentâs development are the keys to student confidence and are provided by our classroom instruction.
