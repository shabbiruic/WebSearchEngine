Few practitioners in public health have doctoral-level degrees, and few doctoral programs focus on the development of leadership skills specific to the public health arena. The online Doctor in Public Health Leadership (DrPH) degree provides comprehensive leadership training in all areas of public health, exposing students to the latest in research, practice, and theory.  The DrPH offered by the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago is tailored to mid-career public health professionals who want to expand their knowledge and practice of public health. With the flexibility to learn online from anywhere around the world, students in the DrPH Program in Leadership will join a stimulating community of peers and renowned faculty en route to an outstanding educational experience.Â  Those who earn the DrPH from UIC will possess the skills to lead practice-based research, influence public health policy, effect change in health systems and institutions, and assume key roles in the public health community at local, national and international levels.      Program Vision    Our vision is to build a cadre of dedicated public health leaders who can set strategic direction, drive transformational change, create responsive systems, and contribute to the evidence base of public health practice.
