The department develops scholars, researchers and leaders in the areas of curriculum and instruction; literacy (language and culture); math and science education; bilingual/ESL education; and teacher education.  We do this through undergraduate, master's and PhD course work, and through research. Our programs are designed to attract students who are committed to social, racial and economic justice.  Our work in the department supports the mission of the College of Education by preparing high-quality educators and researchers to work effectively in Chicago neighborhood schools, institutions of higher education, and other urban educational and community agencies. Our educators and research foster leadership in urban education locally, nationally and internationally.       Department Contacts      Maria
