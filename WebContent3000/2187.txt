Ninety percent of a childâs brain growth occurs before Kindergarten. Early childhood educators bear a huge responsibility in supporting early development and learning as well as a childâs academic, social economic and health trajectory.  UIC's master's program in Early Childhood Education reflects the most recent scholarly advances about cultural and contextual nature of childrenâs learning, while also responding to the needs of the Chicagoland community. The program was the first in the state of Illinois to prepare teachers to work withÂ allÂ young children regardless of ability, and is today still one of very few that offer blended curriculum in early childhood and early childhood special education.  The program educates professionals dedicated to working with young children and their families across a wide range of settings. During the program, students have the opportunity to earn an Illinois Professional Educator License (PEL) with endorsements in Early Childhood Education, Early Childhood Special Education, the Illinois Gateways Level 5 Early Childhood Education credential, and/or the Illinois Early Intervention credential.
