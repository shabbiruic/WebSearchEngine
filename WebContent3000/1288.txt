The college offers a curriculum for advanced social work practice in four areas of specialization: Mental Health, Child and Family, Organization and Community Practice, and School Social Work Practice. Also available to students enrolled in the MSW program (separate application required after admission to the MSW program) is a Certificate in Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice with Children approved by the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE). In addition to the programs outlined above, the Jane Addams College of Social Work and School of Public Health offer a joint MSW/MPH degree program.  Full-time students complete the degree in two years. A three-year masterâs program, known as the PM-Extended Study Option, is also available. Under the PM-Extended Study Option, students extend the usual first year of full-time study over two years, with classroom courses scheduled in the late afternoon and evening. Students in the first year of the full-time program and for the first two years of the PM-Extended Study Option are assigned a class schedule by the Jane Addams College of Social Work. In their third year, PM-Extended Study students must register for full-time study. Students in their specialization year are not preassigned a class schedule; daytime or evening class sections are offered to all specialization-year students.  For applicants who have earned a Bachelor of Social Work degree from a CSWE-accredited program within the last six years, the college offers admission with Advanced Standing. These students typically complete the Master of Social Work Program within two semesters.  The Master of Social Work at UIC is considered a professional program and is not administered by the Graduate College.
