Transcripts of all undergraduate and any graduate work must be submitted. In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, applicants must meet the program requirements as listed below. See theÂ School of Architecture website Â for the most up to date application requirements.   To apply directly to the joint program, students must apply to each of the individual degree programs separately, noting that they are applying to the joint program. To be admitted to the joint program, a student must meet the admission requirements for each individual degree program.  Students who enter the three-year MArch program and later decide to transfer into the joint program may do so before entering their second year of study if they meet the admission requirements of the MAD-Crit program.  Students in the joint program will be advised by the School of Architecture Graduate Academic Advisor, who will ensure each student understands and fulfills the program and course sequence requirements. The advisor will also provide guidance regarding elective selections.  Students who choose to leave the program before completing the requirements for the joint degree may receive either the MArch or the MAD-Crit degree if the requirements for one of the individual degrees have been met.  The application deadline for this program is earlier than the Graduate College deadline; for information about current deadlines, please see the School of Architecture website.Â   Degree Requirements  The requirements for the degree vary according to the studentâs previous studies and level of preparation. The Graduate Admissions Committee of the school will specify, at the time of admission, the program to which each student has been accepted. In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, students must meet the following program requirements:   Minimum Semester Hours Required 128    Course List         Course  Title      MArch Core Courses (72 hours)  ARCHÂ 561 Architectural Technology I  ARCHÂ 562 Architectural Technology II  ARCHÂ 563 Architectural Technology III  ARCHÂ 564 Architectural Technology IV  ARCHÂ 551 Architectural Design I  ARCHÂ 552 Architectural Design II  ARCHÂ 553 Architectural Design III  ARCHÂ 554 Architectural Design IV  ARCHÂ 555 Design Development  ARCHÂ 565 Topic Studio  ARCHÂ 567 Research Studio  ARCHÂ 573 Architectural Structures I  ARCHÂ 574 Architectural Structures II  ARCHÂ 522 Topics in Architectural Technology  ARCHÂ 544 Professional Practices     Course List         Course  Title      MAD-Crit Core Courses (24 hours)  ARCHÂ 587 Pro-seminar I: Design Criticism  ARCHÂ 588 Pro-seminar II: Publication and Graphic Argumentation  ARCHÂ 589 Writing Tutorial I  ARCHÂ 590 Writing Tutorial II  ARCHÂ 520 Topics in Architectural Theory and History  400- or 500-level approved elective     Course List         Course  Title      Shared Requirements for MArch and MAD-Crit (32 hours)  ARCHÂ 531 Architectural Theory and History I  ARCHÂ 532 Architectural Theory and History II  ARCHÂ 585 Architectural Theory and History III  ARCHÂ 586 Architectural Theory and History IV  ARCHÂ 566 Research Seminar  ARCHÂ 520 Topics in Architectural Theory and History  400- or 500-level approved elective in Art History  400- or 500-level approved elective  Portfolio Submission  An annual portfolio review occurs during the spring semester of each academic year.
