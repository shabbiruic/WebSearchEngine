The OTD focuses on developing advanced professional skills for practice, leadership, management, and education. For the currently practicing occupational therapist, an OTD offers opportunities for career development and advancement. For a currently enrolled masterâs student, an OTD offers the opportunity to enter the field with more specialized knowledge and skills. In comparison to a PhD, the OTD focuses less on conducting original research and more on applying existing research and evidence to improve everyday OT practice.  The OTD program emphasizes UICâs scholarship of practice and mentoring model. Students work closely with faculty members within their lines of inquiry, which assures that students have top-quality experiences doing mentored work that is relevant, forward-thinking, and that will make a difference in practice and in the lives of diverse occupational therapy clients. Students are admitted to this competitive program only when there is a good match between student interest and faculty scholarship and expertise.  The OTD is composed of five major components:   Core courses (research, theory, proseminar)  Advanced practica (clinical, teaching, leadership/management, and scholarship of practice applied research)  Elective courses  Field exam  OTD Project (major work in advanced area of specialization)   The Doctor of Occupational Therapy at UIC is considered a professional clinical doctorate degree program, not a graduate program. Applications for this program are processed through the Department of Occupational Therapy. For more information on the OTD program, admission requirements, and the application process , please consult the Department of Occupational Therapy website.
