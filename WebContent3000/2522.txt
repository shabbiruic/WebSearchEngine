The Minority Health Conference is a yearly gathering where professionals and students from allied health fields come together to uncover and focus on eliminating the health challenges encountered by marginalized populations.This conference seeks not only to shed light on health inequities that persist in marginalized communities, but to also build a task force of emerging leaders and professionals to address these issues at the local, regional, and national levels.  2019Â Theme  Advocacy is an integral aspect of social change. The 2019 conference's theme was Advocacy for Change: Celebrating Past Successes and Planning for the Future, honors how advocacy efforts are instrumental in advancing the health of minorities. For our 40th year, we honor past activist successes and set the stage for communities to continue their work as advocates or as change makers.  Public health is an active and integral actor in these for social change. As field, public health must intentionally shed light on disparities that persist due to structural and social inequalities and provide pathways to promote better health for all. This year, we have curated a forum that sets the stage for more effective and engaging advocacy efforts in our communities far and near.  Registration for the 2020 conference will open soon.       Fundraising   At the present time, we are still looking for Conference Sponsors! Sponsorships allow us to continue to offer cost free-attendance at the conference, which assures that it remains accessible to a diverse audience of students, educators, health professionals, community members, and any who share a commitment to confronting and eliminating health inequities.
