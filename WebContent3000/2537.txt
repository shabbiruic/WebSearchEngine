Â While valuable immediately upon graduation, it can be used throughout your entire career.  UIC certainly has a formal office to guide you during your career journey with a few more services at the outset to help you get going when you graduate. Â But in addition, from the moment you stop foot in CUPPA Hall, you are faced with myriad opportunities to start networking and defining the areas in which you want to pursue a career.       The Office of Career Services at UIC      UICÂ Career Services is an available resource for all CUPPA alums.Â Up to one year after graduation, as aÂ most recent alum, you have access to all services offered, including individual advising appointments.Â  If you graduated more than a year ago, take advantage of workshops, career fairs, and access toÂ UICcareers.com .  If you are looking for opportunities to engage with and recruit students for jobs and internships, you can post open positions on the UIC Career ServicesÂ online database and volunteer for panel discussions and mock interviews.  You can also directly target CUPPA students by email job and internship posts to CUPPA@uic.edu.    UIC Career Services         CUPPA Alumni-Student Mentorship Program      In its ninthÂ year, the CUPPA Alumni-Student Mentoring program matches seasoned, successful alumni with current MPA and MUPP graduate students. Â Students are given the opportunity to explore various career topics and discuss the realities of the professional planning/public administration environment.  The program requires an 8-month commitmentÂ withÂ mentor-protÃ©gÃ© meetings taking placeÂ monthly over the fall and spring semesters of the academic year. Â  Face-to-face meetings are encouraged, but email and phone conversations work too.Â MonthlyÂ communications, including suggestions for other social events will be provided throughout the year.  The CUPPA Alumni Association believes that this is a great way to stay connected with the CUPPA community and to help current MPA and MUPP students who seek Â guidance.
