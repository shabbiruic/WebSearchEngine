It will never replace the personalized coaching or the accountability factor you’ll get from a real life personal trainer, but it can help you get started.  You can ask absolutely anything to do with diet, fitness, goal setting, motivation, building muscle and more. No question is too silly or too complicated. We will post questions anonymously on our website so others may benefit from questions asked.  Please note, we aren’t doctors and can’t offer medical advice.

How many days a week do I need to exercise?         How many days a week do I need to exercise?   How many days a week do I need to exercise? According to the American College of Sports Medicine, adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week for cardio-respiratory exercise (30-60 minutes of moderate intensity five days per week or 20-60 minutes of vigorous intensity three days per week).Â  Resistance training should include training major muscle groups 2-3 days per week.        What should I eat before I workout?         What should I eat before I workout?   What should I eat before I workout?  Before a workout your body should be fueled with an adequate amount of carbohydrates and fluids three to four hours before working out.Â  Ideally, you will want to consume high carbohydrate, low fat meals prior to exercise.Â  Some examples of high carbohydrate foods are one bagel, one apple, one orange, one cup of plain pasta and one Gatorade energy bar.

After a workout a person should consume 1.0 to 1.2 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight during the first four to six hours after the workout is completed.Â  If you feel like eating after exercise is not for you, you may want to consider a liquid that is high in carbohydrates.

How do I stay fit during the quarantine and avoid weight gain?   Weight gain is usually a combination of excess calories (from eating) and not expending enough through movement. It is a balance of both to maintain our body weight, so starting an exercise plan and making small modifications to eating habits as well.  For exercise plans, you need to find activities that you enjoy because that will help you stay with an exercise plan.Â  During the stay at home orders, the options are definitely different.Â Â  I am including some links for online programming.Â  One is online Zoom classes taught by our Drop In instructors (live and recorded options) and the other is online resources from the fitness industry.Â  What activities do you like to do?Â Â  What were you doing before the stay at home order?  Generally a well-rounded exercise plan includes:  Strength training  -strength training should be done 2-3 non consecutive days per week, 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps, for each major muscle group  -body weight options like squats, lunges, tricep dips, push-ups, core work  -or get creative with making some weightsâlike your bookbag filled with some books (adjustable for what exercises you are doingâyou want to make it slightly challenging: squats, lunges, overhead press, bicep curls, tricep extension, chest press), or grabbing something heavier that might be around your home such as gallon of water,  -strength training should include all major muscle groups 2-3 non-consecutive days per week  Cardiovascular exercise  -adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.Â  (30-60 minutes of moderate intensity at least 5 days per week or 20-60 minutes of vigorous intensity at least 3 days per week)  -If going outdoors (walking/jogging/running/hiking) be sure to practice social distancing and to monitor your intensity.  -Online resources are provided in the links.Â Â  One of the instructors put together HIIT workouts at home.Â Â  She has a video clip of the exercise and the timer all ready for you!  With any exercise program, you want to be sure to include a warm up and a cooldown to your workout.Â  This can be starting the movements with lighter or body weight, gentle stretching or building on the intensity of the workout.  The number 1 excuse for not exercising is time.Â  So be sure to schedule your workout into your day/planner.Â Â  Set aside a designated time to do your workout will help you maintain the fitness schedule.

Are there any specific exercises or goals I can set for that?         how I can lose the fat around the thigh? Are there any specific exercises or goals I can set for that?   When it comes to losing fat anywhere in the body, we canât dictate where fat is loss in any specific area. One thing I ask clients do to is look over their eating habits. All exercise needs to be supported by realistic eating habits. Itâs the foundation to successful goals. In addition to that I would recommend an at home routine including lunges, squats, push-ups and crunches.
