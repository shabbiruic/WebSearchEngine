The College of Education at UIC is striving to lead that charge for Chicagoland schools and beyond. In order to increase the pipeline of men ready to teach and lead, it is essential that we provide our MiSTERs with the necessary resources to place them in the best position to positively impact the lives of children and young adults.       Tuition Assistance   With the rising costs associated with higher education, providing our Misters with the foundation of being able to remain in the program is vital. A gift at one of the following giving levels will provide financial need-based scholarships:  $10,000  $7,500  $5,000  $2,500  $1,000    Give Now         Career Preparation Assistance   Our MiSTERS receive a comprehensive program that surrounds and fully engages them year round to ensure optimal success. A gift to one of the following areas will provide assistance to help our MiSTERS meet the additional costs and reach their capacity:  -Attending National Education Conferences: $1,500  -Teacher Exam & Licensure Fees: $1,000       Corporate Sponsorship   If your company is interested in learning more about the impact of a corporate sponsorship gift of $25,000 , please contact Dr. Alfred Tatum , Dean of the College of Education.
