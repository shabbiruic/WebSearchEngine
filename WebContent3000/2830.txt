More than half (63%) of 3rd-graders in the Chicago area have cavities! If cavities are not treated, they can cause many problems such as:   Pain  Severe Infections  Malnutrition  Speech Difficulties  Poor School Performance  Cosmetic Problems  Lower Quality of Life   CO ordinated O ral H ealth P romotion (CO-OP) ChicagoÂ is working to fix this problem.  CO-OP Chicago is a research study that tests different approaches to improving the oral health of Chicago children. CO-OP Chicago will train community health workers about oral health and cavity prevention. CO-OP Chicago will place these community health workers in primary care pediatric clinics and Women Infants and Children (WIC) centers, and send them into homes to study participants.  The goal of this study is to see what works best to support families to develop healthy behaviors that reduce caries.
