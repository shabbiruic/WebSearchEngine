The recipes and the stories featured here, from the Latino community and other immigrant communities, reflect some of the ways that people incorporate new and old into their everyday life here in Chicago. Food is part of how people carve a place for themselves in this diverse and changing city, where so many cultures, dialects, foods, and art forms thrive. Through these pages, we can see continuity and change in food traditions and social practices.
