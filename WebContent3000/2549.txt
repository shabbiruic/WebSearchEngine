The short answer is that we are trying to make the places we live better for everyone. That can mean different things to different people and there are certainly many ways to go about it. Â And that's really why there is a UIC CUPPA.  We look at the history, theory, and practice of why we live where we do and what we need in the places we live. We add that to our newÂ research, newÂ Â data, and newÂ information. After that,Â we remember our dreams. We getÂ creative and use our imaginations. Finally, weÂ share our work to help residents go about making things as fair as they can be, get through the tough times if and when they happen, and be prosperous.  We believe in our mission.Â We promote just, resilient, and livable communities.

CUPPA’s two undergraduate programs have 130 students. Our five graduate programs have 375 students. That means personalized attention from the faculty and staff across the college.  Thirty-fourÂ full time faculty members teach our undergraduate and graduate classes. Adjunct faculty members hired specifically for their expertise in a particular topic in the Chicago metropolitan region are added for special course topics.  Our very own building, CUPPA Hall adjoins our Art and Exhibition Hall, which serves as the home for our contemporary, technologically enhanced classrooms. Our building also supports meeting rooms, computer labs, lounges, and discussion spaces for students 24/7. In the final stages of completion, CUPPA Hall underwent renovations totaling over $7 million.      Questions?
