The program covers a broad range of laboratory disciplines with an emphasis on analytical and interpretative skills for people who seek careers in forensic science and criminalistics.       About the Field      Forensic science is a broad field in which different scientific fields are used to analyze physical evidence in relation to matters of the law.  Forensic sciences encompass:   forensic medicine  dentistry  anthropology  entomology  chemistry  biology/DNA  biochemistry  toxicology  fingerprint technologies  questioned documents  firearms and toolmark examination  Trace analysis  and other pattern analyses.   Criminalistics is a branch of forensic science generally including the analyses carried out in forensic science laboratories.       A Word on Background Checks      Most, but certainly not all, forensic science opportunities are in law enforcement. TheseÂ agencies conduct rigorous background checks which may include:   polygraph tests  testing of urine for drugs  testing of hair for drugs  guidelines to past drug use   This is true for employment as well as for internships.  As a guideline, agencies generally tolerate limited Â marijuana use in your past and typically prohibit hard Â drug use.  In addition, if you are not a citizen of the United States orÂ a Permanent Resident, you may have difficulty finding employment in law enforcement agency laboratories as well.         Graduate Successes      Our graduates are employed by such places as:   DEA labs  U.S. Army CID lab  New York City Medical Examiner lab  Navy Investigative Services  FBI lab  And laboratory systems all across the United States.   The Past 5 Years   Between 2015 and 2018 the Forensic Sciences program accepted 36 students.  Seven students will graduate in the spring of 2020.  Of the 25 program graduates between 2013 and 2018:  21 are working in forensic science laboratories across the country.  2 are engaged in Ph.D. research.  2 are working in research laboratories.
