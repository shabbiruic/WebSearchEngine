Named for three Chicago-based organizers whose work exemplifies transnational solidarity and international movement-building: Prexy Nesbitt, Rosi Carrasco, and Martin Unzueta. Â The scholarship recognizes outstanding UIC students whose commitment to justice encourages all of us to think beyond the real or imagined borders of issues, nations, and struggles.  This past yearâs Border Crossing scholarships was given to Carolina Gallo-Villalobos with the 2018 Border Crossing Scholarship. Carolina is majoring in Latin American and Latina/o Studies at UIC. She has worked with Young Chicago Authors, Real Chi Youth, and ElevArte Studio in Pilsen.  Carolina is a member of Fight for $15, an Urban Planning and Policy Fellow at the UIC Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement, and a data analyst for the Latin United Housing Association. Â The selection committee was extremely impressed with Carolinaâs academic and community work.
