DEPTH         i                     Due to the COVID-19 pandemic UIC continues to accept undergraduate first-year and transfer applications for the Fall 2020 semester.            Centralized Application Service Overview    A number of programs at UIC utilize centralized application services (CAS) as their primary application.  These services enable applicants to designate multiple institutions using a single set of application materials instead of applying and submitting materials to each institution separately. They apply mainly to programs in the health professions at this time.Â  Information covering basic Admissions policy for these applications is below. Note that allÂ policies may not be applied for Professional level programs. Inquiries concerning CAS proceduresÂ should be directed to the program directly.  Breakdown of Programs by Department and CAS association  Deparment  Program(s)  CASÂ  Student Level  Department of Occupational Therapy  MS OT  OTCAS  Graduate  Department of Physical Therapy  DPT  PTCAS  Professional  College of Dentistry  DMD  AADSAS  Professional  College of Pharmacy  PharmD  PharmCAS  Professional  School of Public Health  MS, MPH, MHA, PhD, DrPH  SOPHAS/HAMPCAS  Graduate  The programs noted below require the submission of the applicable CAS as part of the application process.Â These programs also require the submission of a supplemental institutional application and fee.         Transcripts/Credentials    Included in an applicant's record, the CAS provides a verified list of USÂ coursework with grades and confirms degree awards. When obtained from the CAS, these are accepted as official credentials. Graduate applicants would only need to submit official paper transcripts directly to UIC if they have been admitted pending the completion of their Bachelor's degree program prior to the start of the admission term. If CAS-provided documentation is insufficient, Admissions may request the upload of acceptable credentials prior to admission.  If the CAS does not accept and include copies of international credentials, these will be requested to be uploaded through the application checklist after the CAS record reaches its final stage (Verified orÂ Mailed). CAS services do not often verify foreign coursework due to the varying systems of foreign study. If copies of institution-issued credentials are included with third-partyÂ evaluations (such as WES) provided to the CAS,Â theÂ institution-issued credentials included in the evaluationÂ will be usedÂ for application review within Admissions.Â         English Proficiency Scores    English proficiency test scores must be reported to UIC directly. Refer toÂ theÂ English proficiency requirements Â for appropriateÂ submission directions. Test scores reported to the CAS services will not be used in place of scores officially reported directly to UIC.         Application Fee and Waivers    Fees submitted to a CAS are charged by the CAS for the use of its services and are not shared with participating institutions.  UIC requires the submission of an application fee or selection of a qualifying waiver in order to submitÂ the supplemental institutionalÂ application. Please note that waivers offered by the CAS do not apply to the institutional application fee and waivers offered by UIC may not apply to CAS fees.  See our Application Fee Waivers page for complete details.         Program Application Review    Programs review these applications independently of the Office of Admissions.Â In most cases, applications for these programs will likely have already begun being reviewed within the program before the Office of Admissions obtains the finalized CAS record. At times, the program may reach an admission decision before all Admissions-required items have been received if they feel they have enough information to offer admission. Requested Admissions items not included in the CAS record will need to be received before institutional application records can be updated with a final admission decision.         Application Status    Applicants to these programsÂ should monitor the applicable CAS portal as programs use those for updates based on their own review.Â Applicants may also check their status through the institutional "supplemental" application system to see if a final decision has been applied or Admissions-required documents are being requested.  International applicants will need to use the institutional application system to submit OIS-requested documents for visa processing after admission.         Use of CAS Records for Other UIC Applications    Please note that CAS application records are valid only for approved programs within the specific department for which it is required. Applicants who may also be applying to non-CAS programs for the same term must follow the appropriate application materials submission procedures for those programs.
