What is the difference between finance and accounting?   To begin with, finance and accounting deal with very similar concepts and terms. In both finance and accounting you would deal with assets, liabilities, equity, profits, losses, investments, etc. However, time  horizon and risk constitute the major difference . Accounting deals with the past and present account balances, flows, and transactions. Finance takes things from there to make decisions for the future periods, which are uncertain. Given that the future is never certain, even to the best and the brightest of financial decision-makers, at the heart of finance lies risk. Investing is risky since you are not guaranteed a return. Borrowing is risky because you may default. Budgeting is risky because you can never forecast your financial inflows and outflows with certainty. Starting a business or undertaking a new project is risky as it may turn out disappointing and ultimately fail. And so on. All financial decisions involve the passing of time and balance risk and return.        How rigorous is finance?         How rigorous is finance?   Most people who are just being introduced to finance think it is an exact science with right and wrong answers, cold numbers, solutions that can be programmed with an algorithm, and rigid structure, leaving no room for individuality. This perception is incorrect. True, as you are just starting out at an entry-level position, you would be involved in more structured tasks, but not necessarily. Ultimately, any analysis requires independent thinking and ability to ask open-ended questions. Thatâs how you get an edge against fellow financial analysts: by being able to think in different ways and look for valuable information in places that they havenât considered!  Finance jobs require soft skills in addition to quantitative skills. Many occupations require extensive dealing with clients, customers, bankers, analysts, etc., and do not require for you to perform much quantitative analysis, although solid knowledge, recognition, and application of financial concepts is of course still essential.  Financial analysis requires certain math skills. To succeed in your finance coursework, as a minimum, you need good knowledge of college algebra and statistics. Donât underestimate statistics: financial decisions deal with the uncertainty of the future! Everything we deal with is probabilistic rather than deterministic: maybe the stock price will go up, maybe down; maybe the economy will be strong next year, maybe weak, and so on. For some applications such as portfolio allocation, for example, linear algebra comes in handy; and of course if you want in-depth treatment of financial derivatives such as puts and calls, futures and swaps, you need basic calculus. Finally, most finance jobs need programming skills in addition to math skills. Mastery of Excel is the bare minimum. You need to be able to work with large amounts of data, use pivot tables, run regressions and simulations, and so on. Our curriculum provides a solid opportunity to learn these skills.
