Students are expected to have knowledge of and follow the rules and requirements as stated in the UIC Undergraduate Catalog . It is the expectation of the College the students follow university deadlines. It is recommended that students who experience extenuating circumstances that prevent them from meeting a registration revision deadline petition for an exception to a deadline.  Petition discussions originate with your assigned academic advisor in the LAS Academic Advising Center. When a request merits consideration, the student may be asked to submit a written petition that includes the desired outcome and justification for the request. The petition must be accompanied with supporting documentation, which may include faculty/instructor feedback.Â It is the studentâs responsibility to provide documentation in support of a petition. To be eligible for consideration, a petition must address an academic term within the last two years.Â Submission of a petition does not imply approval.Â Former students may submit petitions to the Office of the Dean, LAS Student Academic Affairs, third floor, University Hall.  Petitions are considered regularly by a committee of LAS deans and academic advising professionals in the Office of LAS Student Academic Affairs.Â Appeals of negative outcomes should be directed to the Executive Assistant Dean at baroess@uic.edu. Appeal meetings are not held.
