The PGY1 and PGY2 programs strongly prefer that references be from three clinical preceptors but recognize that is not always possible for PGY1 candidates.  PGY1 candidates are strongly encouraged to not delay submitting their application for a âmost recentâ transcript. There have been too many issues with Registrarâs offices closed for winter break creating a delay in âcompletionâ of the application while awaiting the transcript.
