By systematically examining biological, environmental, cultural, behavioral, historical, economic, and political factors that impact health, students in the program become informed citizens who can consider the publicâs health in whatever life roles they assume.  With a Bachelor of Arts in Public Health, graduates can pursue entry-level positions in the public health workforce or graduate school within the health sciences or related fields by building the necessary prerequisite course work into their studies. Those who go on to careers in medicine, nursing, or dentistry (to name a few) will find that the School of Public Health provides a broad foundation in the biological and behavioral sciences, viewed from social ecology and population-based perspectives. Our graduates emerge from the program prepared to tackle health equity and social justice issues.  During their first two years, students complete prerequisite general education course work including introductory courses in public health. Once admitted to the major, students spend their final two years engaging in the major course work sequence as a true community of learners. In addition to the core public health courses, students also work with their advisors to select a complement of courses focused on their professional and/or academic goals.

Foreign Language Requirement (16 semester hours)   The basic requirement is proficiency in a language that has a recognized literature or culture. The level of proficiency must be the equivalent of that expected of the student who has completed the elementary and intermediate levels of language study (i.e., the first two years) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Students studying foreign language at UIC are strongly encouraged to register for required language courses in consecutive semesters until the requirement is met. Students may satisfy the requirement in any one of several ways:   By presenting qualifying scores on Advanced Placement examinations in foreign language, a qualifying score on a UIC foreign language placement test, appropriate course work as awarded per the State Seal of Biliteracy, or other authorized proficiency test for languages not offered at UIC.  By transferring credit for two years of a single language at the college level.  By completing four semesters of language courses at UIC. The university currently offers complete sequences in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.  By completing a partial sequence of language courses as determined by the results of a placement test or placement by a language department. The school determines eligibility for credit in a recommended course.  By presenting evidence of secondary education completed in a country where the language of instruction was other than English. No elementary- or intermediate-level course or proficiency credit will be given for that language. The language requirement, however, will be considered fulfilled only if the student consults their Advisor for application of this rule and receives conditional approval.  By transferring four semesters of credit in American Sign Language courses from an accredited U.S. college or university. Courses must include the study of deaf culture.

STAT 101 or STAT 130 is recommended.  Grade of B or better in a mathematically oriented or quantitative course in a department in LAS other than Mathematics.
