His postdoctoral work was in biomedical informatics at the University of Michigan.  Dr. Boydâs research focuses on âdata simplification to improve clinical outcomesâ engaging administrators, researchers and patients.  His recent research success was in simplifying the transition for International Classification of Disease version 9 clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) to version 10 (ICD-10-CM), which occurred on Oct. 1, 2015.   Over 200 news publications has cited his work including (Crainâs Chicago Business, Modern Health Care, Healthcare Informatics, Politco.com, Inside Health Policy and many more).  Another area of data simplification to improve clinical outcomes is designing patient engagement tablets apps in cardiology and oncology to improve medication adherence through empowering the patients. The concept is to transform the data from the electronic health record system to engage patients in their own care to improve medication adherence.
