However, summarizationÂ research has mostly resulted in summaries composed of sentences extracted whole from the text. First, we workedÂ on generating summaries composed of subsentential fragments that are recombined to create new sentences (XieÂ et al., 2004;Â Xie et al., 2008 ). In more recent work, we used information extraction and generation techniques toÂ produce summaries of reviews of songs for a Music Recommendation System ( Tata & Di Eugenio, 2010; Tata &Â Di Eugenio, 2012). One current project applies summarization to the generation of patient-centric summaries ofÂ hospital stays, which integrate information that comes from both discharge notes, written by doctors, and nursingÂ notes. Our first result computationally confirms our intuition that there is very scant overlap between the notesÂ written by doctors and by nurses for the same patient (Di Eugenio et al., 2013a).
