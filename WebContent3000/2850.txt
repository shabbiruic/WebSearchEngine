The Institute is structured as a campus-wide interdisciplinary research, policy, and practice unit that is governed by a Director and an Administrative Council, advised by an Executive Board, and located in the College.       Article II â Vision       The Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy is a leader locally, nationally, and internationally for producing, supporting, educating about and advocating for research on race and public policy, particularly engaged research on underserved racial and ethnic communities in urban settings.       Article III â Mission and Priorities       The mission of the Institute is to promote, coordinate, and conduct innovative research at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and public policy. The Institute represents a strategic commitment by UIC to better address and promote growing racial and ethnic diversity within the university itself, the Chicago area, the state of Illinois, the nation, and the world. Housed within the College, this university-wide institute has a special focus on historically underrepresented people of color as they are affected by, and as they seek to affect, public policy. The Institute has developed a multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural agenda that includes African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups of color confronted with systematic racial and class barriers.    A central aim of the Institute is to increase the quantity, quality, relevance and impact of research on racial and ethnic groups that face persistent inequities, inequalities, and disparities. To promote greater access and diversity, a primary agenda is to improve both the understanding and conditions of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups that continue to experience major difficulties within contemporary urban settings. Toward this end, the Institute strives to be a central locus for a range of policy-relevant research, education, and service activities guided by a strategic set of priorities. Those priorities are: policy-relevant scholarship on race and ethnic diversity; and engaged research on pressing racial justice and public policy issues.       Article IV â Governance and Management       The Director of the Institute is responsible for ensuring that the Institute meets its overall mission and vision, and works closely with both internal and external partners to improve continuously its core programs and to develop new ones. The Director is a senior-level faculty member at UIC, appointed by the Provost and Dean of the College for a term length mutually agreed upon by the Dean and Director. The Director initiates, develops, coordinates, and conducts research designed to improve knowledge and understanding of historically under-represented groups within the U.S.; develops and promotes faculty and student research activity; and oversees the budget and daily administration of the IRRPP. The Director is supported by a dedicated Executive Board comprised largely of faculty members and reports to an Administrative Council of college deans, chaired by the UIC Provost, for policy direction, and to the Dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs for operations and management.  The Administrative Council is responsible for providing strategic and fiscal oversight and accountability for the Institute. The Administrative Council is chaired by the Provost and consists of deans and other campus administrators whose units have significant academic and financial investment in research on race and public policy. The Director is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Council. The Administrative Council meets regularly to review the progress of the Instituteâs work and to give advice to the Director, the College Dean, and the Provost.     Article V â Advisory Boards       The Executive Board is responsible for providing guidance and support on academic,programmatic, and organizational matters. The Executive Board consists of faculty members and staff with expertise on race and public policy from a range of relevant campus units, the Chancellorâs Committees on the Status of Latinos, Asians and Blacks, Ethnic Studies departments and units from both east and west campus. A graduate student can be selected as an ex officio member. The Director is an ex-officio member of the Executive Board. In consultation with existing Board members and relevant campus units, the Director will assemble a slate of nominations for Board members, to be voted on by existing Board members at the end of each academic year for a following year. Duration of the term is two academic years, renewable for up to four consecutive years. The Executive Board elects a chair or co-chairs for one-year terms who are responsible for assisting the Director in planning and facilitating the Board meetings, and communicating to the Director any concerns raised by the Board. The Executive Board meets at least three times a year. All decisions of the Board will require a two-thirds majority of those present at a duly called meeting. In addition to its other responsibilities, the Executive Board also has the authority to evaluate the Directorâs performance and to call for an Executive Session. The Executive Board will evaluate the Director at the end of each academic year and will submit the results of the evaluation to the Administrative Council. At the end of the Director's term of appointment, the results of that evaluation will be sent to the Administrative Council to consider in making the decision for possible reappointment. The Executive Board may call an Executive Session as needed in order to review the performance of the Director. The results of the Executive Session will be communicated by the Chairs of the Executive Board to the Administrative Council for consideration.  The External Advisory Board is responsible for providing advice to the Director on producing research that is policy-relevant and responsive to current challenges and opportunities related to racial and ethnic diversity in urban settings. The External Advisory Board consists of key stakeholders from the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Community and beyond who have the potential to influence policy at the local, regional, state, or national level. The Director is an ex-officio member of the External Advisory Board, and is responsible for calling and facilitating the meetings of the Board. Members of the External Advisory Board are appointed by the Director, in consultation with the Executive Board, for a term of one academic year, renewable by the Director.     Article VI â Operations       The Faculty includes Research Faculty, Faculty Fellows, Faculty Scholars, and Faculty Affiliates, all of whom are responsible for contributing to the core research, education, and service functions of the Institute. Research Faculty are appointed for designated periods to work on externally funded projects. Faculty Fellows are awarded release time from their campus units for their work with the Institute. Faculty Scholars are provided with research grants to support the development and dissemination of scholarly work. Faculty Affiliates are appointed for designated periods to work on the Institutesâ research initiatives or related activities. The Director may offer courtesy and/or visiting appointments for designated periods, consistent with College procedures, to Research Faculty or Faculty Affiliates in order to support their work with the Institute.  Post-Doctoral Scholars, Research Assistants, and Research Trainees provide support on research projects or related educational or service activities, while receiving professional development in research on race and public policy. Post-Doctoral Scholars are graduates who received their doctoral degree within five years of appointment. Research Assistants are graduate students at UIC. Research Trainees are undergraduate students at UIC. All are appointed for designated periods at the discretion of the Director.     Article VII - Bylaws       The Director or the Executive Board may initiate changes in or additions to the existing by-laws.  Changes require a two-thirds majority of those present at a scheduled meeting to become effective.
