Â She developed a women’s health questionnaire focused onÂ exual and reproductive history, contraception, nutritional status and health perceptions. Â She worked with a community health worker to learn about communities in western Kenya and developed skills with geographic information systems to build a database of the assessment’s results.          John Kaleekal spent his applied practice experience in 2018 at the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center at Cook County Health working on a national online-survey study that monitors HIV diagnoses among young queer and trans people. He continued working at the clinic after his practicum as a full-time employee, allowing him to present research at conferences around the U.S. He says his practicum reinforced his value of working in queer and trans spaces for the queer and trans community and colored his graduate experience in ways he did not expect, from better understanding sexual health among young queer people at a structural level to providing support to young people living with HIV.
