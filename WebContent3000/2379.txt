Â MPH students gain background knowledge in reproductive/perinatal and pediatric epidemiology, and with the analytic and leadership skills necessary to enable them to engage in data based decision-making to promote the health of the maternal and child health population. Students are given the tools necessary to turn âdata into informationâ to improve the health of women, children and families.  The degree is a concentration of the MPH in Community Health Sciences and MPH in Epidemiology degrees. Â The degree is coordinated by the UIC Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health, one of only 13 centers nationwide funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Â The UIC Center of Excellence also offers an MPH in Maternal and Child Health.  The Center's mission is to train future and current professionals to address health inequities among women, children and families. Curricula are rigorous, evidence-based and steeped in social justice, practical experience, and collaboration with communities and various maternal and child health partners. The Center's goal is the development of local to global leaders focused on supporting the health and well-being of women, children and families.  MPH students participate in internships in state or local public health agencies across the US learning how to conduct analyses with datasets including vital statistics, PRAMS, BRFSS, and the National Survey of Child Health. Â Students alsoÂ meet leaders in the field both through attendance at the MCH EPI/CityMatCH conference and through attendance at an annual UIC-SPH MCH EPI lunch focused on âmy MCH EPIâ journey. Â Graduates have participated in the CSTE fellowship, joined the Epidemic Intelligence Services, and have gone onto become CDC Maternal and Child Health assignees in state Title V/MCH programs.  Students select one of two tracks, in either the Community Health Sciences division or the Epidemiology and Biostatistics division. Â All students complete the school-wide core requirements and the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology concentration requirements; students will complete the divisional core requirement specific to the track they have chosen.       Program Tracks     Community Health Sciences Track   Students complete the divisional core in Community Health Sciences, with courses focusing on assessing and promoting the improvement of community health and the planning of community health interventions.     Epidemiology and Biostatistics Track   Students complete the divisional core in Epidemiology, with courses focusing on epidemiological modeling, epidemiology in computing and how epidemiology addresses chronic and infectious diseases.
