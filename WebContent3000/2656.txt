At the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the program serves 160 undergraduate students. Students are enrolled at different levels of the college journey, but remain with TRIO/SSS until their time of graduation. Since its inception more than 30 years ago, over 1,300 of our SSS participants have graduated with bachelorâs degrees from UIC.  As a program, we strive to give students the skills, knowledge, and tools to thrive at UIC while providing a supportive environment and sense of community. We offer academic coaching, tutorial services, career and graduate school exploration, study room support, and referrals to other services.
