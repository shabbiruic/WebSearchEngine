We invited a number of seasoned and loyal volunteers to create Founding Committees, charged with examining overall operations, awards & traditions, college and unit engagement and student to recent alumni engagement. Each committee worked to assess our current state and recommend strategies to help us grow and improve.  Thank you to the following alumni volunteers who spent countless hours working diligently to meet that charge. We are extremely grateful for their dedication, time and expertise.
