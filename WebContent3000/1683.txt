UIC is ranked 8th on the âBest Valuesâ list of the nationâs universities, according to the 2020 edition of the Wall Street Journal and Times Higher Education rankings. The âBest Valuesâ list, which assesses overall ranking, tuition, fees, housing, and federal and institutional aid among the top 250 overall schools, placed UIC in the top 10, ahead of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Princeton University.  UIC also ranks 33rd and in the top 10% overall in the environment category, which assesses student and staff diversity, student inclusion and the proportion of international students.    U.S. News & World Report ranks UIC among the top 20 ethnically diverse national universities in their 2020 âBest Collegesâ rankings, as well as No. 61 among U.S. public colleges and universities and No. 132 among all U.S. universities.  UIC also ranks No. 14 in social mobility, a new category, which assesses the graduation rates of Pell Grant recipients.    UIC is ranked 5th in the âBest Bang for the Buckâ rankings in the Midwest region by Washington Monthly magazineâs 2019 College Guide, which ranks 372 schools according to how well they âhelp non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices.â   Washington Monthly ranks four-year schools based on their contribution to the public good in social mobility (recruiting, enrolling and graduating low-income and first-generation students); research (research expenditures, number of bachelorâs recipients who go on to receive a Ph.D., faculty awards); and providing opportunities for public service (encouraging students to give back).    Money magazine ranks UIC within the top 100 colleges that are a great investment for your money (rankings considered educational quality, affordability, and alumni success).    Our students have access to unparalleled educational, cultural, and professional opportunities in Chicago and the world: 42% percent of UIC undergraduates pay no tuition to attend UIC and 98% of LAS students were accepted to programs at other universities and chose to come to UIC.    82% of UIC students receive need- or merit-based grants and scholarships. 52% of undergraduates receive Pell grants.    UIC has frozen in-state tuition for the last four years in row.           Diversity        A Vibrant Community Committed to Diversity...       UIC and LAS embrace diversity in our faculty, students, and staff, as well as the subjects we teach and the work we pioneer. We have no racial or ethnic majority.    LAS is made up of individuals who bring different backgrounds, perspectives and life experiences with them, and our most profound accomplishments result from conversation and collaboration among these many viewpoints. The College is thus committed to doing all that it can to maintain and support meaningful diversity, and to take full advantage of this diversity by ensuring inclusion and promoting the flourishing of all members of the LAS community. This attitude and the actions it implies are part of the fabric of daily life in LAS, and are expressed in a wide range of its programs and activities.    UIC received its third consecutive Higher Education
Excellence in Diversity award from INSIGHT Into Diversity
Magazine, the oldest and largest diversity-focused
publication in higher education that recognizes U.S.
colleges and universities with an outstanding commitment
to diversity and inclusion.    UIC has received the designation of Hispanic-
Serving Institution, or HIS, by the U.S. Department of
Education, and is also an Asian American and Native
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPSI).    UIC is one of only four Carnegie designated Research I
Institutions in Illinois. There are currently only 115
Carnegie R1 universities in the United States, and UIC
is one of the very few R1 minority-serving institutions in
the nation.    UIC now serves 31,683 students, breaking last yearâs
record of 30,523!   LAS has also seen its largest first-year
class in at least thirty years.           Faculty        World-Class Faculty at the Helm...       LAS faculty include: Fulbright Fellows, Guggenheim Fellows, a MacArthur Fellow, National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) awardees, National Science Foundation (NSF) winners, Humboldt Fellows, Alfred P. Sloan Fellows, American Council for Learned Society fellow, and National Book Prize and PEN/Faulkner Award finalists.    LAS is home to 11 endowed chairs as well as 11 active NSF Career awardees.    $120M was granted as a Department of Energy investment to support an Argonne National Laboratory JCSER battery hub of collaborating scientists and institutions led by LASâ Physics Professor George Crabtree.    $2.5M was awarded to the LAS Math, Statistics and Computer Science department through a prestigious NSF Research and Training Group Grant.    A $1.1M John Templeton Foundation grant was granted for research on the philosophy of space, time and quantum gravity led by LASâ Philosophy Professor Nick Huggett.    Pulitzer Prize finalist
and LAS English
Professor Luis Urreaâs
latest book House of
Broken Angels has
earned him the title of
âone of our most
important American
public intellectualsâ as
reported by the
Chicago Tribune.    LAS Chemistry Professors Cho and newly recruited Professor Zhou are the only recipients of a prestigious National Institutes of Health R35 Maximizing Individuals' Research Award (MIRA) on campus.    Aixa Alfonso, a professor in Biological Sciences, is the principal investigator of a $5.2M Department of Education grant that is awarded to Hispanic Serving Institutions to increase enrollment and graduation rates of Hispanic and low-income students in STEM degrees.           Research        Advancing the Frontier of Knowledge...       UIC is one of only four Carnegie designated Research I (R1) institutions in Illinois. R1 is the highest rating for a research institution from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, the gold standard for standard for assessment.    At UIC LAS, undergraduate students have the unique opportunity to conduct original research under faculty mentorship through the LAS Undergraduate Research Initiative (LASURI). Projects range from studying the psychology of poverty to examining the thermal evolution of the moon.    $100M+ in external research funding has been generated by LAS's Learning Science Research Institute (LSRI)
faculty members to support research on learning and teaching, particularly in the Chicago
Public Schools.    Royalties from the HIV/AIDS drug (Prezista) have brought in over $24 million to LAS making it (to date) the most successful royalty producing patent ever developed by University of Illinois faculty. A portion of these funds is endowing four faculty chairs in the sciences. Not only is Prezista an important treatment option for patients with drug-resistant HIV, but it was made available to the worldâs least developed nations at a price far lower than the U.S.âs commercial price.    $2.5M was awarded to the LAS Math, Statistics and Computer Science department through a prestigious NSF Research and Training Group Grant.    LAS has received nearly $1.9M in grant funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. $1M will create opportunities for four successive cohorts of 80 first-year students to take part in engaging humanities courses, workshops, and lectures each year, leading to a major research project and career or graduate preparation in their junior and senior years of study.    LAS is the recipient of a $1M Howard Hughes Medical Institute Inclusive Excellence (HHMI) grant to grow a
professional learning community of STEM educators.
