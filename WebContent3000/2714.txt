The Center works on a number of programs in collaboration with the other six CCUSC. These include:   Heritage Garden : ArabAmCC contributes to the internship program of the heritage garden. Interns spend a week during the summer with the ArabAmCC exploring issues around environmental and food justice and its relevance and implications in the Arab region and its diaspora.  Reimagining Masculinity : opens up a space on campus to speak about masculinity, unpack what does masculine mean in the different cultures, and look at its intersections with various other aspects of oneâs identity.  Yearly Thematic Program : CCUSC organize a series of collaborative events around a specific theme on a yearly basis that the ArabAmCC contributes to envisioning and programming.  Solidarity : Working in solidarity with other movements, communities, and struggles enriches the experiences and definitions of our community. Engaging in solidarity and collaborative work allows students to expand their frameworks and understandings of what it means to be Arab in the Arab region and in the U.S., to learn from others' experiences, and make connections with other communities in order to collectively contribute to building a just and equitable society for all.
