The Latino Cultural Center is one of the few spaces on campus available at no charge for events and meetings organized by UIC departments and units, registered student organizations, and community partners. We ask from everyone who uses the gallery space to please follow ourÂ procedures and regulations . Failure to do so may result in denial of future space requests.      Fall 2020 - Please read the following before submitting a space request form:   Space request forms will not be considered until mid-August.     1) Who can reserve the Gallery?  UIC departments, units, registered student organizations or LCC community partners.If you are not one of these, your request will be denied.   If you are submitting this form on behalf of an outside organization or because you are a member of such organization, your request will be denied. In other words, your event or meeting must be a project or effort of a UIC department, unit or registered student organization.  We define community partners as organizations that collaborate on projects with the LCC.   2) When is the Gallery available?  The Gallery is available from 9am to 5pm Monday thru Friday. You can request the Gallery for after hours: Monday thru Thursday from 5pm to 8pm.   The GalleryÂ CANÂ be available after hours on Friday, Saturday,Â orÂ SundayÂ onlyÂ IF Â a LCCÂ studentÂ worker is available.  TheÂ useÂ of the Gallery onÂ Friday nights and over the weekendÂ by UIC student orgs, department units and/or external community partners requires a paymentÂ fee. ThisÂ feeÂ covers the payment for a LCCÂ studentÂ worker to be present and help with space logistics the day of your event (including AV, amplifier, and receiver with a limit of 4 connections). However, theÂ LCCÂ studentÂ worker will not be responsible for setting up or cleaning the space after your event.  Â The rate is $15/hr , which will have to be paid directly to theÂ studentÂ in the form of aÂ check or cash Â the day of the event.   3) What else should I know?
