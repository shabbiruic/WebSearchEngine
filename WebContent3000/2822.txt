Researchers at IHRP particularly address challenges of communities disproportionately burdened by chronic disease, premature death, social inequities, low incomes, and under-resourced schools.  Biology, genes, behaviors, attitudes, stigma, income, social structure, racism, health services, the built environment, policy — all these factors influence the health and well-being of individuals, communities and populations.  UIC social and health scientists working at the Institute seek to understand the complex interactions and effects of these influences. These researchers advance basic knowledge, theory, and innovative methods in the social and health sciences. They build and test interventions. They examine pressing social issues to inform policymakers, and they partner with communities to develop strategies backed by science to improve their quality of life, well-being and overall health.  Understanding and addressing these intersecting influences often requires an integration of multiple disciplines, methods and theory to answer research questions and advance social sciences and community solutions.  This kind of complex, multidisciplinary research is highly prized today, especially as complex health and social problems — chronic disease, mental health disorders, income disparities — increase and have no easy solutions.  To thrive, researchers investigating these complex social and health challenges depend on a solid structure of administrative and scientific professionals, whose expertise specifically supports grant-funded research. That is what UIC researchers find at IHRP.  IHRP attracts faculty and other scientists committed to conducting research and advancing the social and health sciences. IHRP is where ambition is supported.
