Tyler Portis      As a high achieving student from the Chicago Public School system, Tyler Portis, a third-year business management student, is not afraid to get involved or ask for help. Since attending UIC, there have been key programs and support services that Iâve utilized, such as the African American Academic Network (AAAN) Retreat and Project LEAD through the Residence Life Project, a three-day program to develop leadership skills. Both were great!  Once the semester started, I began meeting with my AAAN advisor every other week. I didnât feel like I needed it to survive, but I wanted to make sure I would do well in my classes. My advisor was great because he would suggest resources that I never thought of. As far as learning strategies, I hang up my syllabi on my bedroom wall so I can visually see what my assignments are and when they are due. Iâve also realized that I learn best if I work with others and talk it out. Lastly, I learned that my professors expect real research, quotes, and evidence, so once I started reading more and annotating, I was able to learn a lot.  Besides my jobs as a resident assistant, campus tour guide, and orientation leader, Iâm also involved with the Student Activities Board (SAB). As a business management major, I see how these leadership and management techniques actually play out in real life. Itâs cool to see how my coursework overlaps with my involvement on campus.
