WeÂ connect students to Chicago's abundant, vibrant theatre culture and to the city's dynamic jazz and classical music networks.  School of Theatre & Music ProgramsÂ  Our Music curriculum provides a thorough grounding in theory, history and literature, ear-training, piano skills, and ethnomusicology. Music students participate in performance ensembles including Choirs, Jazz Ensembles, Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, University Band, and a number of chamber music groups.Â  Tell me more about UIC music degrees  Our Theatre curriculum emphasizes a balance between practice and theory, with courses in acting, movement, voice, script analysis, directing, writing, adaptation of literature for the stage, devising, design, technical theatre, and stage management, as well as history, contemporary performance techniques, and performance ethnography. Students enjoy individual attention in small classes, and the opportunity to work on up to four mainstage productions, as well as a number of student productions, each year.Â  I want to know more about UIC theatre degrees  We have nine music ensembles open to non-majors for credit (or simply for fun!). They perform a huge variety of repertoire, from established classics to world premieres, all over Chicago.  I want to get involved  Every year, we present four mainstage theatre productions and more than 50 concerts. All of our performances are open to the public!  When is the next performance?
