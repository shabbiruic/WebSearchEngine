Students are considered for admission to the PharmD program with a minimum of 62 semester hours of accrued undergraduate credit; however, the MS in Health Informatics requires an earned bachelorâs degree. For students who apply to the PharmD without a baccalaureate degree, the program provides a course planner showing the sequence of course work that meets the intent of the previously earned bachelorâs degree admissions requirement for the MS. Students will be permitted to take BHISÂ 460 , available to upper-level undergraduate students, in the fall of their second year in the PharmD curriculum. They will be accepted to the MS in Health Informatics the spring of their second year, at the point in the PharmD curriculum in which they will have accrued 128 semester hoursâthe baccalaureate equivalent.  Degree Requirements  In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, students must meet the following program requirements:   Minimum Semester Hours Required 153â157.
