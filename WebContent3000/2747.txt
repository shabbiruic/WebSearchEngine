Taylor St., Rm. 116,Â provides early childhood education to the preschool children of UIC students, faculty, and staff.    Lactation Facilities  Located across both east and west campuses, UIC offers lactation rooms for use by faculty, staff, and students. (Content warning: the linked page uses gendered language. WLRC recognizes that people of all gender identities may use lactation spaces.)    Student Organizations  UIC is home to hundreds of student organizations that provide a great way to get involved on campus and meet others with similar passions. We encourage you to find one that interests you or start up a new one!    The Wellness Center  The Wellness Center provides health and wellness information, educational programs and events, and skill-building activities and workshops to the UIC community, including conflict resolution, healthy relationships, sexual health, and stress relief.    Parking Services  UIC Parking Services has developed a new program which provides convenient parking spaces for expectant childbearers.Â This Program applies to any UIC faculty, staff member, or student who is in the third trimester of their pregnancy and already has a parking permit from Parking Services*.  (Content warning: the linked page uses gendered language. WLRC recognizes that people of all gender identities may wish to take advantage of this program.)  The expectant parent will need to obtain documentation from University Health Services (UHS), and will then be able to request a transfer from their current lot to a closer, more convenient parking lot. Each case is handled individually based on medical circumstances and the individualâs destination on campus. Â Generally, lot transfers will be granted 11 weeks prior to the due date for a pregnancy with no complications, and will expire seven days after the expected due date.  To participate in the Expectant Mother Parking program , the participant should fill out this request form .  For more information or questions about this program, please contact UIC Parking Services: (312) 413-9020 (East Campus) or (312) 413-5850 (West Campus).  *If the UIC faculty, staff member, or student does not already have a parking permit, they may purchase either a standard assignment for one semester or a temporary monthly permit from Parking Services and then have that space transferred to the closest available lot for the duration of their third trimester.
