Our scholars and educators are actively seeking solutions, creating pathways, and leading efforts to shape educational practices and policies in Chicago and beyond. Our faculty, staff, students, and alumni advocate on behalf of children, particularly Black and Latinx children, in Chicago and around the nation. As a public institution dedicated to serving students and learners of all ages, we are making good on the promise of public education.
