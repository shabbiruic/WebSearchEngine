We have two areas of support that you can donate to: The Social Justice Initiative Scholarship Fund and the Social Justice Initiative Support Fund.  The Social Justice Initiative Scholarship Fund Â supports the Pipeline to Justice (P2J) Scholarship Program. Since 2012, the P2J program has been an academic conduit for diverse students with non-traditional backgrounds who have a track record of community organizing and commitments to social justice.The program funds activists who are returning to UIC to complete their undergraduate degrees. In addition to the scholarship, P2J scholars also receive mentoring opportunities and access to all SJI related events and programs.  The Social Justice Initiative Support Fund Â is a general fund to help us sustain our ongoing work. Your donation will contribute to our lectures, exhibitions, workshops, films, discussions,and conferences that shine a light on persistent injustices as well as ways that people work together to create change.Â All of the our programs encourage UIC students, faculty, and staff to connect with community members and organizers to address pressing social justice issues in Chicago and around the world.
