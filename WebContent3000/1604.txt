For example, students interested in a Health Policy specialization must take PUBHÂ 100 , PUBHÂ 110 , and PUBHÂ 120 as prerequisites for PUBHÂ 310 , PUBHÂ 330 , and PUBHÂ 350 . PUBHÂ 100 is a U.S. Society course and PUBHÂ 110 is a World Cultures course, so each one can fulfill General Education requirements as well. Check the Course Descriptions for prerequisite requirements for all courses.  Course Options for Public Policy Specializations  Students may choose any 200-, 300-, and 400-level courses for the 9 hours in specialization requirement. The following groups of courses are offered as guidance to students who may have an interest in any of the educational paths shown below. Students may choose a specialization from the list or customize their own (e.g. communication policy) with consultation and approval of their advisor. All specializations must be approved by the undergraduate program coordinator in the Department of Public Administration, who will seek endorsement from the appropriate department(s) offering the advanced course work. Students interested in pursuing a minor in any of these areas should refer to the Undergraduate Catalog for further requirements not listed here. Consult the Schedule of Classes for terms during which courses are offered. The Department of Public Administration does not determine course offerings in other departments.
