The MSE doctoral program spans P-20 mathematics and science education in urban settings in and out of schools. The focus is on developing new knowledge that improves science and mathematics education and has an impact on the communities we serve. Students engage in coursework and research experiences that guide them to view issues of learning, teaching, curriculum, assessment, and policy through sociocultural and sociopolitical lenses where equity, social justice, race, language, culture, and identity are essential considerations.  Students who enroll in the MSE PhD program are required to complete a minimum of 98 semester hours of coursework beyond the baccalaureate degree or 66 hours beyond the Masterâs degree. Coursework beyond the Masterâs includes 24 hours of the College of Education core, 12 hours of the MSE core, and 12 hours in one of the two disciplinary strands (i.e., mathematics education or science education).  Program faculty members are widely recognized as leaders in their respective fields. They have published extensively on the educational experiences of African American and Latino learners, and bring to their research and teaching strong disciplinary education in STEM fields. They also have considerable records of mentoring and preparing scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups, as well as preparing and collaborating with P-20 science and mathematics teachers and faculty.  Graduates of the MSE program are well-prepared to assume a variety of positions in colleges, universities and informal educational settings to improve the mathematics and science education for children, adolescents and adult learners through research.
