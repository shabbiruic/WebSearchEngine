Tracy Baynard , associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition and director of the laboratory, and Deepika Laddu , assistant professor of physical therapy, were honored for research, educational and volunteer activities related to cardiovascular diseases and stroke.  The Integrative Physiology Laboratory takes an interdisciplinary approach to research on cardiovascular function, from the cellular to the whole-body level.  Baynard studies the interactions between obesity, exercise and cardiovascular function, particularly how exercise could improve health among populations with chronic conditions like diabetes or heart failure. Her work has focused on people with obesity, Down Syndrome and multiple sclerosis.  Baynardâs AHA-related activities include serving on grant review panels and reviewing abstracts and manuscripts for AHA scientific sessions and journals.  The overall goal of Ladduâs research is focused on applying lifestyle and behavioral strategies to reduce and/or manage the burden of chronic disease in the growing aging population. She focuses on body composition and muscle strength, bone development and physical function related to conditions like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Laddu is active on AHA committees and has reviewed abstracts forÂ AHA Epidemiology and Lifestyle Council meetings. She developed and teaches courses for the PT departmentâs Healthy Living Practitioner program supported by the AHA .
