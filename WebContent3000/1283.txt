The Master of Arts in Real Estate program at the UIC Liautaud Graduate School of Business combines economics, finance, and urban planning to provide students with a full perspective of the field of real estate. The program takes advantage of UICâs location by emphasizing urban real estate markets and by using metropolitan Chicago as a working laboratory. The program is intended for professionals working in either the private or public sectors that are concerned with real estate and real estate development issues. Students will learn the basic principles of economics, finance, urban planning, urban land use law, and sustainability issues that are needed to gain fundamental knowledge of the operation of urban real estate markets, methods of real estate finance, and systems used to plan and regulate urban real estate development. The purpose of the program is to turn students into educated professionals in the field of urban real estate.
