The MHA Preceptorship is a critical component of the practitioner-educator model and an essential element in establishing the studentâs management skill set.  Each student is placed in a health care organization based upon their career interests and professional goals. Placement sites will reflect the range of the diverse environments in the health care sector and will include inpatient health care, medical group management, post-acute care, community-based health services, and public policy formulation.  The student Preceptorship experience starts in May of the summer semester following the students first year in the program and continues for a 12 month period. During this time the student spends a minimum of 25 hours per week at the healthcare organization under the guidance of an experienced preceptor. Students become involved in a number of different types of projects involving process improvement, quality and safety enhancement and strategic planning.
