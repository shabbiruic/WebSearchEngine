We believe that the very act of being engaged adds to the foundation of skills and dispositions that are essential for thriving here at UIC but also living a productive life after college.       Student Engagement   Leadership and Post College Success provides programming designed to inform and prepare upper class students of career and professional school opportunities as they move closer toward graduation from UIC. The goals of Leadership and Post College Success are to:   Provide undergraduates with a comfortable place to explore their post-college interests.  Assist in providing undergraduate students with the necessary tools and information for attainment of their long-term educational goals; and  Connect undergraduate students with various units and campus resources to facilitate their career and graduate school exploration.    College Transitions and Persistence assists new students in completing a smooth transition from their previous institution to UIC. New students are assigned an academic advisor where they can assess the studentâs academic as well as career interest. Additionally, AAAN staff participates in new student orientations and host campus visits for student groups and community organizations.  Academic Enrichment provides programming aimed at enhancing studentsâ academic prowess by pairing students with a peer tutor who will help the student overcome challenging coursework.
