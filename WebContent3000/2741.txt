Though UICâs Womenâs Leadership and Resource Center focuses on the prevention of sexual violence and other forms of interpersonal violence throughout the year, Â SAAM is an opportunity for us to reflect on the work of our center and the larger UIC community.  Through our Campus Advocacy Network program, we have witnessed an increase in conversation and action throughout the university. Faculty and staff are engaging in dialogues within their departments about sexual violence, harassment, and discrimination. Undergraduate and graduate students are spearheading much of the discourse, through student organizations and campus activism. Seeing this growth on campus encourages us to continue supporting the activism of survivors, concerned students, and their allies. We applaud those who share our sense of urgency to address sexual violence and invite you to partner with us in this endeavor.  Please join us this month and beyond to learn how to support survivors, understand bystander intervention, and create a culture of care and action.       Past Events      FEMINIST FILMS:Â NO!
