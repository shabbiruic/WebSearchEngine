Students in the GSAV Campus Certificate will learn visualization theory and the effective use of various visualization tools. They will also recognize when, how, and with which audience each of these tools will be most appropriately used. GSAV students will also develop basic skills in computer visualization and GIS, including knowledge of data management and manipulation, composition, spatial analysis, and cartography and map design.  All students will develop a working knowledge of Geographic Information Systems, and each student will develop more advanced skills in a particular aspect of geospatial analysis and visualization (advanced visualization techniques, Geographic Information Systems, or complexity-based modeling for planning and policy). Students will be able to develop skills in specific computer technologies and software packages currently used in professional settings (including image processing, agent-based modeling, and web authoring tools) and will also be able to effectively address both the conceptual and technical issues of how to make complex information clear and effective for diverse audiences.       Course Requirements   The GSAV Certificate consists of three required courses and one elective course. A total of 12 hours is required for the campus certificate.  The courses (8 credits) required of all students are: – UPP 458 Introduction to Geospatial Analysis and Visualization I (2 credits) – UPP 459 Introduction to Geospatial Analysis and Visualization II (2 credits) – UPP 461Â (formerly UPP 508) Geographic Information Systems for Planning (4 credits)  Each student will also select an elective (4 credits) that allows them to develop more advanced, career-relevant skills in a particular aspect of geospatial analysis and visualization. The elective may be chosen from the following courses: – UPP 462 Intermediate GIS for Planning (4 credits) – UPP 463 Complexity-based Models for Planning and Policy (4 credits) – UPP 464 Advanced Visualization Techniques (4 credits) – UPP 465 Special Topics in GSAV (1-4 credits)  The GSAV Campus Certificate takes 9-15 months to complete, depending on when the student is admitted, course load, and schedule of course offerings.
