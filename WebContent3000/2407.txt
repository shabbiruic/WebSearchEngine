Â Faculty Profile          As an environmental chemist, professor An Li, PhD, studies how human activities influence the natural environment and how those changes in turn affect human health. In the lab, she measure many persistent, bioaccumulative and potentially toxic organic chemicals in air, water, soil and sediment, as well as in blood and placenta of human. She uses this date to show how these pollutants transport and transform in the ecosystem, how human are exposed and how all these depend on molecular structure and other factors.
