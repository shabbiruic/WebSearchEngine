FUA wasÂ created in Fall 2013, by UIC undocumented students, out of their struggle to be recognized as part of the student body and lack of resources allocated to this specific campus population.Â FUA Â highlights the topic of immigration throughÂ storytelling Â while advocating for academic and financial equity. In efforts to accomplish this, Jocelyn MunguÃ­a ChÃ¡vez was part of the hiring committee for the position of theÂ Associate Director for Equity and Inclusion Â and FUA members have been stakeholders regarding the proposed IL legislationÂ Student ACCESS Bill .      fua             Fearless News               Stories               ACCESS Bill               UIC undocu-student support              archives              Annual Reports & Documents    40th Anniversary Celebration    FUA Archives    Noche de Poetas Archives    Past Programs â by year     Past Programs: 2011-2012    Past Programs: 2012-2013    Past Programs: 2013-2014    Past Programs: 2014-2015    Past Programs: 2015-2016    Past Programs: 2016-2017    Past Programs: 2017-2018    Past Programs: 2018-2019    Past Programs: 2019-2020      Past LCC Team Members    Photos    Stories     Historias Monarca (Monarch Stories)    Honoring the Dead    Love & Peace    Passing Down Family Recipes    Migration & Transformation    Butterfly Postcard Campaign      Spotlights                         Rafael CintrÃ³n Ortiz Latino Cultural Center         Donate    Donate         Contact   803 S.
