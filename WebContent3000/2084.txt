The Global Health Program at the School of Public Health is dedicated to the training, attainment, and contribution of new knowledge to face these challenges. This website provides students, faculty and our local and global community partners with information about the exciting global health activities that are underway within the School and provides resource links to external opportunities, events and organizations dedicated to the improvement of health around the globe.  We look forward to your involvement.
