The curriculum provides a strong foundation in the areas of applied statistics, geospatial applications, and data visualization, but balanced with traditional core subjects in public affairs. The program is designed to develop a substantial capacity for students to solve complex public problems with information technology. Graduates will have skills that will be highly desirable in many employer contexts, including information offices in city, state and federal agencies; large nonprofits; technology consulting firms, and government contractors. The program is also committed to finding ethical solutions to problems and reflect public values.  The MSCA program is suitable for individuals with a diverse array of baccalaureate degrees, including those with backgrounds in public policy, political science, statistics, information technology, geography, mathematics, computer science, and economics. Students can take advantage of the expertise contained within the collegeâs nationally prominent research centers, including the Urban Data Visualization Laboratory, the Network Governance Laboratory, and the Urban Transportation Center. The program also works to integrate students into the cityâs civic tech community, helping to provide a valuable form of service-learning while also acquiring skills from field-leading practitioners in civic technology.       Admissions   Degree Required: Bachelorâs degree  Baccalaureate Field : Baccalaureate degree holders in any field are eligible for admission to the program.
