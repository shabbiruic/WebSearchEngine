One Health [Human-Animal-Environment]: The inextricable relationship among animal, human, and environmental health as determined by, e.g., evolutionary biology, human behavior, and environmental phenomena.  Cultural Relevance : The lens through which life events are experienced and interpreted and through which meaning is ascribed.  Local/Global Impact : Appreciation for the global systems that influence the processes, dynamics, and activities of the worldâs populations; health as a multi-faceted state shaped within, e.g., biological, socio-cultural, geographic, economic, and political contexts.
