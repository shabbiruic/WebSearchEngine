The Joint Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy (BAPP) and Master of Public Administration (MPA) is designed for undergraduates with outstanding academic performance who desire to pursue graduate studies in Public Administration. Students will earn both a BAPP and an MPA degree upon completion.  The requirements for completion of the combined BAPP/MPA degree are identical to the completion of these two separate degrees; however, there are 9 hours of shared course work used for both degrees. Completion of 111 hours at the undergraduate level; plus 9 shared hours counting toward both the BAPP and MPA degrees; plus 45 hours of course work at the graduate level will result in joint BAPP/MPA degrees. Students in the BAPP who have only two semesters of course work left and who have at least a 3.40/4.00 grade point average may register for up to three required MPA courses usually taken in the first year of the graduate degree. The graduate-level courses taken in the senior year will be used at the undergraduate level to fulfill 9 hours of BA elective requirements. At the graduate level, these courses will be required courses. An advisor must approve these courses.  Students may apply to start the program when they enter as freshmen, but must comply with all other requirements for admission to the BAPP program and have an exceptional record; others may apply when they transfer or at any time before their senior year provided that they have a minimum GPA of 3.40/4.00. All students must have a minimum GPA of 3.40 upon beginning the graduate course work in their senior year, and must maintain an average GPA of at least 3.00 in all graduate courses. Should students accepted to the joint degree program fall below this average, they will be on probation for a semester and will remain in the program only if they bring their average back to the required minimum.
