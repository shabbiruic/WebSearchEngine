Which one should I apply for?         Special Ed Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4   Requirements for each group depend on your current teaching credentials and career goals. See the description for each:  Group 1 is for students without an education background, entirely new to the teaching profession, who seek both teacher licensure (PEL) and the Illinois Learning Behavior Specialist 1 (LBS1) endorsement.  Group 2 is for students who are currently licensed teachers (have a PEL) but are new to special education and seek the Illinois Learning Behavior Specialist 1 (LBS1) endorsement.  Group 3 is for students who are currently licensed special education teachers who hold a Learning Behavior Specialist 1 (LBS1) endorsement and seek Illinois Learning Behavior Specialist 2 (LBS2) endorsement(s).  Group 4 is for students seeking new knowledge about special education, but who are not interested in teacher licensure or Illinois endorsements        What exams are required?         What exams are required?   As of July 2019, Illinois no longer has a requirement to show basic skills knowledge; it is assumed in passage into college and graduation. In special education, two state exams are required that you will take in the later part of your program.Â  We prepare you for those two (LBS1 and Special Education General Curriculum).  For admission into the MEd program, the GRE is not required.        What background knowledge or experience do I need?         What background knowledge or experience do I need?   You do not need a previous degree in education or even a related field; we recognize that people can decide at any time to enter education and we welcome you. We do require that you have a bachelorâs degree. We do encourage applicants to gain experiences with youth and/or adults with disabilities in part to observe and wonder, and in part to help ensure interest and fulfillment.        What will I earn that will enable me to teach in Illinois?         What will I earn that will enable me to teach in Illinois?   Students can earn the Professional Educators License (PEL) and endorsements. If you have the PEL (if you are already a licensed teacher in Illinois), you will earn additional endorsement(s).  The endorsement for teaching special education is the Learning Behavior Specialist 1 (LBS1).Â  You will be endorsed to teach students ages 5 – 21 in all academic content areas. When gaining employment, you can choose grade level(s), ability/disability populations, and the kinds of collaborative teaching and inclusionary work you want.  We encourage you to earn additional endorsements also, especially for teaching students for whom English is a second language (ESL) and/or the Early Childhood/Special Education approval.
