Note:  PHYSÂ 141 and PHYSÂ 142 are offered every semester (including summer session). All other physics courses are offered only in the semester indicated.  Note: Students must earn at least 40 advanced hours at a four-year college or university. These hours may include hours in the major.  Note: The UIC General Education Requirement is nine courses:Â Two laboratory courses from Analyzing the Natural World,Â one course from each of Understanding the Individual and Society, Understanding the Past, Understanding the Creative Arts, Exploring World Cultures, and Understanding U.S. Society.Â The two remaining General Education courses can be taken from any category. For example, taking CHEMÂ 122 , CHEMÂ 123 , CHEMÂ 124 , CHEMÂ 125   and PHYSÂ 141 , PHYSÂ 142 fulfills four of nine General Education courses and the Analyzing the Natural World category.
