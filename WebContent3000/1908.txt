Additional Experiential Education Opportunities   Restorative Justice Project  The Restorative Justice Project (RJP) trains law students in restorative justice techniques, so that they become better lawyers. In the RJP, students observe court proceedings and visit jails or prisons to compare retributive to restorative justice approaches in actual practice. Students then put restorative justice principles to work with high school and elementary students in a neighborhood school environment.
