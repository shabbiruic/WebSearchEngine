UIC’s PhD inÂ disabilityÂ studies program addressesÂ disability in its full complexity,Â promoting an awareness of disability that supports individuals in shaping their identities and lives .Â We examine how supportÂ services andÂ social and political change can reduce sources of disempowerment.  Disability studies at UIC offers a unique opportunity to study the multilayered, interactional dynamics Â of disability.

We recognize the inherent tensions that exist between therapeutic, medical and social models of disability, but acknowledge these differences as fertile ground for the development of disability studies as an integrative knowledge base.     I really benefitted from the interdisciplinary nature of the program, which gave me new ways of understanding and experiencing disability.
