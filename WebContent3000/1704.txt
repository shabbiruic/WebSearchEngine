Create Yours Now         Voices of LAS...        A fantastic Sociology program, the inclusion, the location, and a Community College teacherâs recommendation brought me to UIC.Â  Â The support that you get from the LAS advising staff exceeds just planning out your classes. Itâs much more tailored to you and making sure that you have a successful time here. I really appreciate it.Â Â For transfer students, I’d say start slow and get acclimated. UIC is the perfect place to do it!Â Â  Iâm applying for grad school right now. For my long term goal, I want to pursue a research career in Sociology, specifically Urban Sociology and Policies.Â  It is thanks to the Sociology professors who introduced me to those research opportunities that I was able to figure out what I want to do long term.
