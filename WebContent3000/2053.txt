A PhD in the Learning Sciences  UIC's PhD program in the learning sciences takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of learning and the design of learning environments. S tudents pursue the study of learning in relation to a disciplinary specialization of their choosing.  All students take a series of sixÂ core courses Â plus five semesters of the reading seminar Journal Club. These courses are taught by LSRI faculty. They also take a number of electives in an outside disciplinary specialization that they choose in consultation with their advisor. In this way, students are able to pursue a study plan tailored to their own interestsÂ in the arts, literacy, mathematics, computer sciences, biology and more.  We guarantee every accepted student five years of funding.Â  Every student who is accepted to the highly selective PhD program is fully funded for five years, either by fellowship or through appointment as a research assistant.  Students will accrue valuable experience in their chosen discipline.  Students have the opportunity to work as research assistants on a faculty research project that interests them. This work is one of the ways we fund graduate study.  Accepted students join a vibrant, diverse community of research.  As part of a richly diverse student body, students also have the opportunity to contribute to UIC's commitment to serving underrepresented populations by working in urban communities and contexts.       Apply to the PhD Program in Learning Sciences       Frequently Asked Questions     What is learning sciences?         Definition   Learning Sciences is the interdisciplinary study of how people learn, in both formal and informal contexts.  The four key questions addressed by learning sciences:   How do people learn?  How can we promote and improve learning?  How do we know what has been learned?  What learning is valued?   Some things learning scientists do:   conduct research in elementary school classrooms  conduct research in zoos  conduct research in college classrooms  conduct research in museums  design useful learning environments based on research  create tools and technologies to improve instruction  create new forms of assessment  study how assessment feeds back into the teaching and learning process  study cognition  study the social and cultural dimensions of learning  study how emerging technologiesÂ bolster the human capacity for learning  study embodiment and learning           What type of employment is possible with a doctorate in learning sciences         Your Future   Our graduates work   as university professors  as learning designers and researchers for non-profit and for-profit research companies  in design and evaluation centers at local Chicago museums  teaching K-12         Do you have a part-time program? Can I keep my full-time job while pursuing a PhD in learning sciences at UIC?         Part-Time Study   We are a traditional full-time program that holds courses during the day on weekdays. We don’t offer evening or online courses.  We discourage students from working full-time while pursuing their PhD. The program is extremely rigorous. That being said, students often work part-time as research assistants on faculty projects or as TAs.        Will I receive funding as a student in the learning sciences PhD program?         Funding    We are committed to working with our admitted students to ensure support through the fifth year of study. This support usually takes the form of research or teaching assistantships and fellowships.    We also encourage our students to learn more about the resources UIC makes available to you. TheÂ UIC Graduate College Â offers information about grants, assistantships, fellowships, scholarships and loans that are provided by the university and outside sources. TheÂ Office of Student Financial Aid Â may also have relevant resources.Â Tuition and fees Â are set by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.           I already have a master's degree. Can I transfer those credits towards my PhD?         Transfer Credits   Probably, though we consider each student’s situation individually. The admissions process includes an evaluation of the applicantâs record, desired specialization, and a decision regarding any modifications to the Learning Sciences program requirements.
