The annual review will include specific work products completed as part of coursework and fieldwork, and revisions may be required in these products as part of cumulative portfolio reviewed for Comprehensive Examination.  Comprehensive Qualifying Exam  Successful completion of the comprehensive exam is required for completion of the CAS and entry into the Research Project stage of the EdD program. No student with a cumulative GPA below 3.00 or with more than one course remaining to complete will be permitted to take the qualifying examination. The exam will include a review of a portfolio of annual performance assessments designated by program faculty. Students who fail to pass all components after the second attempt may recommended by the program faculty to the Graduate College for dismissal from the program.  The EdD Capstone Case Study  The capstone is the culminating demonstration of professional expertise in lieu of a traditional dissertation for the EdD program.  The case study is to be a âcase ofâ leadership and the initiation, development, and management of organizational improvement processes. The primary focus is not individual programs, policies, practices, and other initiatives that might be generated by those processes (e.g., particular curricular initiatives, parent involvement programs, strategies for improving school climate, etc.). Instead, the primary focus is to be on capacity-building processes, cycles of inquiry, processes of continuous improvement or other organizational improvement processes initiated in a school.Â  Individual programs, practices, and other initiatives would receive attention in terms of how those broader organizational processes are working, what they are producing, and why.  The Preliminary Examination  The preliminary examination is taken at the completion of all course work. The exam is an oral defense of a written Doctoral Research Project proposal. The primary purpose of the preliminary examination is review and approval of the Doctoral Research Project capstone proposal for admission of the student to EdD candidacy.
