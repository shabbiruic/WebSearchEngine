This course will provide a foundation in written, verbal and visual communication. Instruction will be from a practitionerâs perspective with a focus on honing skills that students will use in their everyday work life.  Those skills go beyond simply being able to write a report about current macroeconomic conditions or put together a slide deck for a roadshow. Learning to write means learning to organize, to analyze, to summarize and to persuade. It means resisting the urge to just dump data or to fall into opaque jargon. The elements behind effective writing directly translate to effective speaking, not to mention self-confidence and credibility in the workplace.  As with other aspects of the industry, financial communication is subject to significant regulatory oversight, particularly when the communication is directed toward the public. Instruction will reflect this reality, with students learning how to create content that meets required compliance standards  For more information, contact Terry Badger .      FIN 594 Behavioral Finance   Standard finance theory assumes that market participants are rational, an assumption that leaves basic facts of the stock market unexplained. By assuming that some investors arenât fully rational, behavioral finance better explains some financial phenomena. This course will focus on two areas: limits to arbitrage and how rational traders react to irrational traders, and investor psychology and the deviations from full rationality we can expect to find in financial markets.  For more information, contact Andriy Bodnaruk .     FIN 594 Securities Markets and Trading   Learn how securities are traded in modern electronic financial markets. You’ll uncover the design, operation, and regulation of trading processes with a special emphasis placed on trading simulations related to agency trading, liability trading and market making. This course is suited to people who plan to work or are interested in securities exchanges and high-frequency trading.
