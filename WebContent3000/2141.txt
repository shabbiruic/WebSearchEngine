This includes: 1) research to identify key environmental barriers and supports to least restrictive community living and full societal participation of people with long term disabilities and chronic conditions, 2) research to create and test new consumer-directed and patient-centered assessment tools and item banks to evaluate health and participation disparities, and 3) participation-focused, self management intervention research to effect systems change, action plan environmental and policy issues, and build community capacity related to community living and participation. Joy also identifies as a disabled person and scholar herself and is actively involved in transferring researching findings and knowledge back to disability and aging communities to decrease health disparities and improve health and participation opportunities.  Joy teaches courses in Disability Policy and PAR and Curriculum Design.
