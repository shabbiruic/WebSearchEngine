For students Daâam programs are particularly geared to ensure their academic success and fulfillment. While few of these may necessitate public programming the majority of this work is often conducted in one-on-one conversations and committee work.   Mental Well-Being : includes de-stress events during and before finals week and other programming (including workshops and presentations) providing support for and raising awareness on studentsâ well-being. We consider well-being holistically including providing students with tools to manage intimate and family relationships, identity challenges, managing health related concerns and mental and physical disabilities, work-life balance, in addition to managing school life in general.  Advocacy : includes raising awareness within the campus community (faculty, staff, and administration) about Arab and Arab American cultures and experiences through presentations, trainings, and conversations. It also includes accompanying students facing particular challenges on campus, direct advocacy concerning student needs and services on campus, ensuring adequate information about our student community, and serving on campus-wide committee to ensure representation of our studentsâ needs. If you are interested in an Arab and Arab American 101 presentation at your department or unit, please contact us at arabamcc@uic.edu.  Support and Referral for Challenges : entails listening to studentsâ concerns and directing them to the available channels and entities (on and off campus) that can provide more direct support. This also includes recording incidences of bias and discrimination, ensuring students understand the possible avenues available to them to address such injustices, and accompanying them in the process. It also entails organizing trainings and workshops as needed on racial and gender justice, multi-racial solidarity, disability allyship, and other areas connected to embodying the Centerâs points of unity.  Academic and Career Enrichment : In addition to the internship program, this includes organizing activities that help students with career preparedness and horizon expansion in collaboration with campus centers and community organizations and providing opportunities for public speaking.
