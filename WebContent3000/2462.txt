Â PhDstudents gain background knowledge in reproductive/perinatal and pediatric epidemiology, and with the analytic and leadership skills necessary to enable them to engage in data based decision-making to promote the health of the maternal and child health population. Students are given the tools necessary to turn âdata into informationâ to improve the health of women, children and families.  The degree is a concentration of the PhD in Community Health Sciences and PhD in Epidemiology degrees. Â The degree is coordinated by the UIC Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health, one of only 13 centers nationwide funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services.  The Center's mission is to train future and current professionals to address health inequities among women, children and families. Curricula are rigorous, evidence-based and steeped in social justice, practical experience, and collaboration with communities and various maternal and child health partners. The Center's goal is the development of local to global leaders focused on supporting the health and well-being of women, children and families.  Doctoral students conduct their dissertations with state or local public health agencies utilizing a variety of state and local health data including vital statistics, PRAMS, hospital discharge data, and Medicaid claims on topics such as postpartum contraception, opioid use in pregnant women, severe maternal morbidity, geographic differences in access to prenatal care among racial/ethnic groups, the health and well-being of children and adolescents in foster care, and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.  Students select one of two tracks, in either the Community Health Sciences division or the Epidemiology and Biostatistics division. Â All students complete the school-wide core requirements and the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology concentration requirements; students will complete the divisional core requirement specific to the track they have chosen.  The School of Public Health also offers a PhD concentration in Maternal and Child Health.
