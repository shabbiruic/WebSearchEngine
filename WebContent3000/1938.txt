The Pop-Up Just Arts (PUJA) gallery      The Pop-Up Just Arts (PUJA) gallery is a unique space where UIC students, staff and faculty along with members of the Chicago community attend social justice focused art exhibitions, documentary films, performances, discussions, and community events. Located on UICâs south campus, the PUJA gallery is home to specially curated art exhibits that provoke critical discussions and opportunities for learning. Classes, student groups, and community organizations often meet in the gallery to engage with the art, enhance the discussion of course material, visit with guest speakers, and debate the critical issues of our time.  The Gallery will be open to the public for exhibition tours and to UIC community members for meeting space.
