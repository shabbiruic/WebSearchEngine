The office works to improve the delivery of student services while providing a foundation for professionalism and prepares students to become responsible, dignified members of the legal community. Deans, faculty, and staff are involved in fostering those efforts by modeling professional conduct for students. Members of the legal community, including judges, practitioners, and alumni, will also be involved in helping students achieve these goals.       Programs   Lawyer-to-Lawyer Mentoring Program  UIC John Marshallâs Lawyer-to-Lawyer Mentoring Program allows a mentor and a new-lawyer mentee to earn up to 6 hours of CLE professional responsibility credit free upon successful completion of the program. In late 2011, the Law School, in collaboration with the Illinois Supreme Court Professionalism Commission, launched the Illinois Supreme Court-approved Lawyer-to-Lawyer Mentoring Program through the Office of Professionalism & Career Strategy.  Job Placement Initiative  In April 2011, the Office of Professionalism & Career Strategy began placing students and graduates in jobs in the legal profession. Associate Dean Margaret OâMara Frossard, a former Illinois Appellate Justice and director of the program, meets regularly with leading Chicago professionals to explore and secure job opportunities for students and graduates of UIC John Marshall Law School.  Professionalism & Career Strategy Presentation  The innovative professionalism and engagement presentation invites experienced members of the legal communityâincluding judges, practitioners, alumni, and other professionalsâto visit a wide spectrum of classes during each academic semester. After briefly discussing their own legal careers, the professionals then explain to students what professionalism means in the workplace, how to resolve ethical challenges, how to achieve the skills valued by employers, and how to market those skills.  Law School Survey of Student Engagement  UIC John Marshall Law School participates in a nationally recognized survey that examines trends related to professionalism and engagement. Data collected from UIC John Marshall students is benchmarked against data from other law schools. Our goal is to improve the delivery of services to UIC John Marshall students while encouraging professionalism and engagement in students preparing to enter the competitive legal market.  Professionalism & Career Strategy Luncheon  Beginning with the 2011â2012 academic year, UIC John Marshall holds professionalism and engagement appreciation luncheons in an effort to allow judges, practitioners, students, and alumni to make new connections, solidify existing relationships, and thank members of the legal community who have supported UIC John Marshall Law School.
