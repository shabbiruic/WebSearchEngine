Richard Kogen   Mathematics and Science Education (MSE) PhD Student       Jenna Koritsaris      Biology Teacher, Evanston Township High School  I began my journey through the Curriculum and Instruction PhD program at UIC in the Fall of 2014. Prior to this, I completed a Bachelorâs Degree in Community Health, Health Education at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana in 2010, and a Masterâs of Education in Secondary Education Science at Northwestern University in 2013. I began my teaching career at Prosser Career Academy in Chicago in 2011 and currently teach Biology at Evanston Township High School, both at the co-taught level as well as the earned honors level. I have also previously taught ELL Biology and Earth Science.  My research interests include the health and self-advocacy of adolescents. While I have investigated many other areas of education throughout my time at both Northwestern as well as UIC, health is my passion. I am interested in implementing instruction surrounding diet and exercise within my current Biology curriculum so that students might become more aware of how to properly care for themselves as young adults. In addition, I am also interested in teaching students how to advocate for their own wants and needs regarding their health and well-being.       Rebecca Kotler      I have a BA from the University of Chicago in the Humanities and an MEd from DePaul University in Elementary Education. I came to the MSE program after a decade teaching 3 rd and 4 th grade at Ancona School in Chicago. Before that, I began my teaching career as an elementary school drama teacher while working in the Chicago theater community. As a teacher, I was committed to infusing my classroom with performing arts to deeply engage students with one another and contribute to collective meaning making. Nowadays, I am finishing my coursework in the MSE program, while also a Research Assistant for Project STAGE led by Dr. Maria Varelas. Grounded in sociocultural, sociohistorical perspectives, STAGE is a collaborative of CPS teachers and UIC researchers who plan, implement, and analyze embodied performances of science concepts and practices. We are studying the affordances and constraints for teachers and students when it comes to understanding and communicating science ideas, and constructing science identities through theater and dance.       Janice Mejia, PhD   Mathematics and Science Education (MSE) Alumna       Hannah Natividad      Science Teacher, CPS Daniel Boone Elementary  I was born into a family of educators who instilled in me a love of learning. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Elementary Education from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2001 and my Masterâs degree in Education in 2004, and Iâm currently a National Board Certified Teacher (â07 and â15).  After completing the teacher education program at UIC, I landed my first classroom position in 2001 as a 4th grade teacher in the West side of Chicago and two years later in South side teaching 6th grade science. Currently, I teach 6th grade science in West Rogerâs Park in Chicago. During those early years, I discovered a passion for helping students express themselves and think through the arts.  In 2009, I created an after school dance program called Reading & Dance. My program was designed to use dance in achieving literacy standards and enabling students to develop reading skills as they engage with dance. My program provided students (grades 6-8) with the tools to make dance a lifelong activity â they may become dancers, backstage designers, participants in dance classes for exercise and enjoyment, or simply informed audience members who appreciate the intellectual and aesthetic experience of dance.  For nearly two decades, I have worked with middle school students in a variety of classroom settings using body movement and the arts to make science learning both meaningful and enjoyable. In June 2016, my 6th grade students produced a musical called âChanging Earth,â documenting geological ideas and their origins.  Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Mathematics & Science Education at UICâs Department of Curriculum & Instruction, and a member of project STAGE (Science Theater for Advancing Generative Engagement), a collaboration between Chicago Public School teachers and faculty and students in UICâs Curriculum and Instruction department and the School of Theater and Music. I hope to be able to contribute to research in the area of teaching science through movement and future directions in the integration of performing arts in teaching and learning science.       Betina O'Hara   Mathematics and Science Education (MSE) PhD Student       Janet Omitoyin      Janet Omitoyin is a PhD student in the Department of Curriculum and Instructions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).Â  An astute scholar, Janetâs quest for a solution to the problems of mathematics learning based on her experience as a student and later as a teacher is at the root of her enrollment for a PHD program at UIC with a view to be part of the solution to the systemic problems emanating from inadequacies in the training of mathematics teachers that is at the core of this problem.  Since enrollment at UIC, Janet had dedicated her studies and research efforts on Mathematics Socialization and identity amongst pre-service elementary teachers, an effort at understanding the reasons for lack of interest in the subject with a view to proffer solution and engender/motivate interest amongst this group that will eventually reflect in their classroom practices.  She is currently a Graduate Assistant with UIC Engage, a community focused project that provides help for less-privileged students from K-8 in mathematics, reading and writing. She continues to work as a substitute teacher occasionally to keep abreast with current practices within the school system.
