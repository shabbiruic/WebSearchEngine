Defining factors of a collaboratory include facilitated communication,Â  resource-sharing, and reciprocal engagement.  The UIC School of Public Health Collaboratory â¯for â¯Health â¯Justice is dedicated to enhancing reciprocal engagement between the community and UIC faculty, students, and staff. Our emphasis is on connecting people to each other and to resources that will ultimately improve their public health research, teaching, and practice. We strive to advance health justiceâthat all people would have the power and resources to have agency over their health, which requires addressing systems of oppression such as classism, racism, sexism and xenophobia.
