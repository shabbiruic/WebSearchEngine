There is no minimum required GRE score to apply to UIC SPH, all applications are sent to our programs for review. The MPH programs are highly competitive, so successful applicants typically have scores of at least 150 on each the Verbal and Quantitative sections of the test. Please note that every applicant is given a holistic evaluation of his/her application. No one application criterion will determine an applicantâs admission or denial. Admissions committees review an applicantâs competitiveness in a number of areas. As such, applicants with GRE scores below the recommended minimums are encouraged to apply. In addition, each division has specific requirements regarding prerequisite training, experience, and grade point average (GPA). Please see divisional websites for these specific admission requirements.  What is the minimum GPA requirement for applying to Master of Public Health programs?  Admitted students typically have at least a combined undergraduate/graduate grade point average of 3.00 (A = 4.00). However, as stated above, note that every applicant is given a holistic evaluation of his/her application. As such, applicants with less than a 3.0/4.0 are encouraged to apply if they believe that their application is strong in other areas. In addition, each division has specific requirements regarding (GPA). Please see divisional websites for these specific admission requirements.  Where should I send my official test scores (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, etc.)?  Official test scores should be sent to the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. In addition to sending official test scores, you should also self-report your test scores in the SOPHAS application. Test scores will be verified upon receipt of the official score report. Official Standardized Test Scores should be sent to UIC (UIC-SPH code: 7931; or UIC General Code: 1851). Scores sent to the 7931 code will be automatically forwarded to SOPHAS.  I submitted my application on time, but SOPHAS still has not mailed my application. Â Is it now considered late?  The schoolâs deadlines are made with the 3-4 week SOPHAS verification period in mind. As long as you have e-submitted and completed your application by the deadline, it is considered on time. The verification will have no negative impact on your application.  Is there a UIC supplemental application?  Yes, there is a brief supplemental application with the UIC Office of Graduate Admissions. It includes completing a brief application (personal information, previous schools attended, etc.) and a $70 supplemental fee. You can access that application here. Please keep in mind that the UIC Supplemental Application is required in combination with the SOPHAS application.  Do you have a word limit or specific questions for the personal statement?  Other than the SOPHAS word limit, no. It is generally recommended to keep the statement to 500-800 words and to focus on your interests/experiences in public health and the program you are applying to specifically, your goals with the degree, and why you would be successful in the program. For students applying to research focused programs, the personal statement should also address potential research interests.  Does the school admit students in the spring semester?  In general, all of our degree programs (with the exception of four programs) admit students in the fall semester only. The four degree programs that allow a Spring admission are the following:   MPH in Health Policy and Administration online program  MPH in Public Health Informatics online program  MPH in Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences program  MS in Clinical and Translational Science program   Please note that international students can only be admitted in the spring semester under special circumstances. If you are interested in one of the above four programs for a Spring term and you are an international student, you must contact the department and ask for permission to apply for the spring semester.  If you are interested in applying for one of the above programs, you must submit your application to SOPHAS no later than October 1st. The SOPHAS application reopens each year in mid-August.Â If you are interested in applying for admission to any other degree program other than the four listed above, then the next enrollment date would be for the next Fall term.  Does your school offer the opportunity to take one or two courses as a credit non-degree student?  The UIC School of Public Health offers interested persons the opportunity to register for public health courses in a Credit Non-Degree (CND) status. Thirteen semester hours of course credits and letter grades earned by credit non-degree students may be transferred toward a degree program upon the studentâs acceptance as a degree candidate and with the consent of the academic division to which the student has been admitted. CND students are accepted every semester, however, the number of CND seats available each term is limited. Students interested in applying as a non-degree student can apply to one of the following CND programs:   Non-degree Public Health  Non-degree Clinical and Translational Science  Non-degree Healthcare Administration  Non-degree Health Policy and Administration Online  Non-degree Public Health Informatics   Admission is granted on a first come, first serve basis. Students are strongly encouraged to apply early. Admission as a CND student does not guarantee admission to any of the degree granting programs of the School.
