The PharmD is the highest level of professional education in pharmacy and has been approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) as the sole entry-level degree for the profession.  The PharmD curriculum at UIC emphasizes a patient-centered course of study and provides a structure that will enable students to develop into reflective practitioners with skills and attitudes to anticipate change, criticize, evaluate, and modify practice in a changing healthcare arena. The curriculum also provides a fundamental core of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which in composite, promote the fulfillment of the adopted professional competencies for a generalist practitioner who delivers pharmaceutical care.  The program prepares students to:   enter into the practice of pharmacy to serve society as ethical and caring professionals;  apply knowledge of drugs and drug therapy to solve problems and make decisions on behalf of their patients;  educate, communicate, and collaborate with patients, colleagues, and other health professionals;  learnâprofessional practice is a lifelong learning experience;  practice pharmacy in traditional and nontraditional settings;  assume a leadership role in the future direction of the profession.   To earn the Doctor of Pharmacy degree, students complete a minimum of six years of study: the first two years of pre-pharmacy course work can be accomplished at any accredited college or university; the final four years of professional education are completed at the UIC College of Pharmacy (Chicago or Rockford Campus). The prospective applicant is advised to contact the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) at the College of Pharmacy for further information at (312) 996-7242 or to obtain information from the College of Pharmacy website .

PharmD-PhD Program  In response to industry and academic demands for pharmacists with PhD training, the college offers a joint Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) â PhD degree program. Students enrolled in this program can pursue the PharmDâthe standard degree for pharmacistsâsimultaneously with any of the college's PhD degree offerings. The joint program is highly competitive and designed for select students who have interests in both the clinical aspects of pharmacy and research in the pharmaceutical sciences. With judicious selection and timing of courses, joint program participants can earn both degrees in less overall time than would be required to complete the degrees separately.  PharmD-MSHI Program  This joint degree program integrates Pharmacy Science and clinical practice with health informatics, the goal being identification, collection, processing and management of information to support pharmacy practice, administration, education and research. It promotes the expansion of pharmacy knowledge and leadership and is an important new dimension of pharmacy practice. Students in this joint program learn to identify the social issues that inhibit the effective use of information technology in health care and to apply creative solutions that address these issues.  PharmD-MS-CTS Program  There is widespread consensus that the U.S. is facing a shortage of qualified researchers in clinical research who can apply accelerating advances in basic science and biotechnology to clinical practice as well as to translate clinical science into practice so that these advances improve population health. Graduates of the MS in Clinical and Translational Science (MS-CTS) will have the skills to direct a broad range of clinical studies, including the translation of scientific knowledge into clinical practice, and will be able to interact effectively with all of the complementary disciplines with which clinical investigators need to collaborate.  PharmD-MBA Program  The five-year joint PharmD/MBA program provides students with the business skills necessary to manage health care facilities as well as their own practices. Students spend the first two academic years in the College of Pharmacy. During the summers of the first two years, they can complete up to 16 semester hours of MBA core courses. The third year of the program will be dedicated to fulfilling the remaining requirements towards the MBA through the CBA. If students carefully follow the recommended course sequence, they should be able to complete the program in five years. Pharmacy students must complete all requirements in the College of Pharmacy prior to receiving the MBA.
