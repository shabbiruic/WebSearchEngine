Project SEEEC enriches the MEd Science Education program and the PhD Mathematics and Science Education program at the UIC College of Education.  Project SEEEC priorities include addressing the under-representation of African American and Latina/o science teachers and the need for more chemistry and physics science teachers in the Chicago Public Schools. Teaching Fellows are mentored during their first four years in the classroom through Teacher Inquiry Groups, which are led by Master Teaching Fellows.       Academic & Community Partners   The project builds networks between science educators, scientists, and community organizations that will increase equity and excellence in science teaching across Chicago. It is a collaborativeÂ partnership between Chicago Public Schools (CPS), UIC faculty in   Department of Curriculum & Instruction (College of Education)  Department of Biological Sciences (College of Liberal Arts & Sciences)  Department of Chemistry Â (College of Liberal Arts & Sciences)  Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences Â (College of Liberal Arts & Sciences)  Department of Physics Â (College of Liberal Arts & Sciences)   and seven Chicago area nonprofit organizations:   Little Village Environmental Justice Organization  Project SYNCERE  Friends of the Chicago River  Chicago Botanic Garden  Chicago Freedom School  Instituto del Progreso Latino  Project NIA   Nonprofit partners provide community-responsive professional development that complements the coursework and experiences of all students in the MEd program.       Project SEEEC / L@s GANAs Secondary Science Teaching Fellowship   The UIC Secondary Science Teaching Fellowship provides tuition waivers for Strand A of the MEd in Science Education at UIC and a $10,000 stipend. This fellowship is funded by a grant from the United States Department of Education as an extension of two UIC initiatives: L@s GANAS (Latin@s Gaining Access to Networks for Advancement in Science) and Project SEEEC (Science Education for Excellence and Equity in Chicago). The priorities of this initiative are to support the education and licensure of science teachers from Latinx and other racial/ethnic backgrounds that are underrepresented among Chicago’s teachers.  Applying for this fellowship requires completing this application and also admission to the UIC MEd in Science Education. Accepting this fellowship implies a commitment to teach in the Chicago Public Schools or other districts with similar teaching force concerns and student populations.  Please contact Daniel Morales-Doyle ( moralesd@uic.edu , 312-996-6066) or Carole Mitchener ( cmitchen@uic.edu ) with any questions.
