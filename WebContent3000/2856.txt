Part of fulfilling that mission is funding research on race and ethnicity and training scholars to participate in policy discussions. To this aim, IRRPP supports faculty scholars, faculty fellows, and policy & social engagement scholars. Listed below are some of the previous research projects IRRPP has funded.
