This is a historic time for UIC.Â  We have proudly launched UICâs first alumni association.Â  This new organization will focus solely on UIC alumni and bring our strong alumni network together to support common goals, such as UICâs students and their success.  We have an opportunity now to reimagine the opportunities UIC creates for you to engage with UIC and with one another in meaningful ways.Â  Our community is unique in that more than 80 percent of UIC alumni live and work in the Chicago area, which means we can truly join forces to carryÂ UICâs mission Â forward and help achieve its ambitious goals.  Please explore the services we offer and ways you can get involved, and share your opinions on how you would like toÂ engage .
