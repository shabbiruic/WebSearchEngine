Recommended Plan of Study  Chemistry is a highly structured discipline. Because most advanced courses require physical chemistry as a prerequisite, which in turn requires prerequisites of general chemistry, physics, and mathematics, careful course planning is essential. It is best to start with mathematics and general chemistry in the first year, followed by organic chemistry and physics in the second year, and physical chemistry in the third year. Consult the Biochemistry section for more information on the BS in Biochemistry.  Note: Students who are not ready to start with MATHÂ 180 and CHEMÂ 122 / CHEMÂ 123 should expect to take summer session courses and/or take longer than four years to graduate.
