Students in the Professional Enhancement Program must complete the number of electives necessary to earn a minimum of 42 semester hour credits. The PEP program is intended for students with a minimum of 3 years of full-time public health professional experience. Full-time public health experience would not include clinical work, laboratory work or research (with the exception of applied research). If you feel you have sufficient background to justify PEP status, you must apply for that status at the same time you submit your initial program proposal. PEP status will not be considered after your first semester in the program. In order to apply for PEP status, you must provide an updated resume/CV to your faculty advisor. If your faculty advisor agrees you are a candidate for PEP status, then you must write a statement reflecting how your public health background is consistent with the CHS divisional mission and goals. Your faculty advisor will submit your statement and program proposal to the CHS Academic Coordinator, who will provide it to the CHS Curriculum Committee and Division Director for review. You will be notified if you qualify for PEP status at the beginning of your second term. Both programs are designed for completion in 2 years when enrolled full-time.
