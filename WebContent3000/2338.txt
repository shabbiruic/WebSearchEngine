UIC College of Pharmacy faculty, students, and staff are actively engaged in both urban and rural communities.  Our community engagement and mobilization has included outreach programs addressing diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking cessation, cancer, heart disease, geriatric health, and health literacy. We wish to acknowledge the efforts of our faculty, students, and staff who are dedicated to expanding access to quality care, preventing diseases, and achieving health equity for all.
