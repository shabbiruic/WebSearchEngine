The program has received the University Council for Education Administration Exemplary Educational Leadership Preparation Program Award, and was identified as a âmodelâ program by the Illinois Board of Higher Education Commission on School Leader Preparation.  This intensive, highly-selective cohort model combines coursework with supervised practicum experiences and an emphasis on collaborative data collection and analysis at the school level. With additional coursework and fieldwork beyond the Illinois P-12 Principal Endorsement, the program supports the continued development of novice principals and also prepares system-level leaders to lead school improvement at the district level.
