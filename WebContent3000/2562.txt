Unlike the MPA degree, which focuses on management, finance, and budgeting, the MPP degree emphasizes policy analysis, statistics, and program evaluation. The program is ideal for students who complete undergraduate degrees in the social sciences and humanities who are seeking to strengthen their analytical skills, as well as those in the hard sciences who have an interest in public affairs and public service.Â  Students in the MPP program can concentrate in a variety of specific policy areas including education, health, and planning.Â  The majority of students with MPP degrees gain employment in the public sector (at all levels of government), though 20% are hired in the private sector and 20% in nonprofits.  The program is designed to be a professional degree, but it also prepares graduates for further educational opportunities.Â  The MPP is an often-sought degree for those seeking a JD.Â Â Given its analytic focus and emphasis on research design and assessment of causal relationships, an MPP is also a useful pathway to PhD programs in policy, administration, or in of any of the specialization areas of health, education, and urban planning.       Admissions   The Department of Public Administration requires an undergraduate grade point average of at least 3.00 (A= 4.00) for the final 60 semester (90 quarter) hours of baccalaureate study, including all of the work taken in the term in which the student began the final 60 semester hours of study (programs may require a higher GPA). If your GPA is below 3.0, your application must be approved by the Graduate College.
