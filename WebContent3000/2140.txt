At the center of its mission, UHP has a goal of developing a pipeline of underrepresented health professionals dedicated to improving the quality and availability of healthcare in undeserved urban areas.  Each of the Health Science Colleges at the University of Illinois at Chicago houses an Urban Health Program Office and collaborates with the Graduate College to develop programs and activities to support our studentsâ development as professionals. In addition, our UHP offices provide dedicated support and resources related to the recruitment and retention of our students.
