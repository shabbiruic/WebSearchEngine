The Latin@s Gaining Access to Networks for Advancement in Science (L@S GANAS) program Â at the University of Illinois at Chicago was created through a Hispanic Serving Institution STEM grant from the US Department of Education. UIC is one of a handful of research intensive universities to achieve Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) status. BelowÂ is a list of the ways in which you can be part of L@s GANAS:  L@S GANAS is a multifaceted program at UIC that focuses on the recruitment, retention, and graduation of Latinx students in the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). It was established out of the HSI STEM grant from the US Department of Education. While the program is open to all STEM students, there is a focus on Biological Science, Biochemistry, Neuroscience, and Chemistry, as majors with high rates of Latinx entrance, but low graduation. L@s GANAS includes transition coaching, peer mentoring, campus partnerships, peer leaders, research fellowships, cultural dialogues, field trips, public programs, and more!  Research fellows attend dialogues at the LCC throughout their fellowship, to build community and discuss ways their cultural heritage connects with scientific studies and future careers.
