Admissions Overview     Admissions Overview         ADMISSIONS OVERVIEW    Admission to the School of Public Health is selective and dependent on the availability of space.  Students apply to enter the Public Health major after completing the specified 60 semester hours of prerequisite general education course work at UIC or another accredited college or university. As the major course work sequence begins only in the fall semester, students typically apply in the spring semester of their sophomore year for admission the following fall semester.  A cumulative GPA of 2.50 or above (UIC GPA and UIC Transfer Credit GPA) is recommended. A 2.75 or above is recommended for priority consideration but does not guarantee admission.  First-year students may apply for admission to the Public HealthâUndecided (Pre-Public Health) program within the School of Public Health where they will then complete the prerequisite course work necessary for future admission to the full major.  Current UIC students or transfer students from other institutions who will not have completed all of the prerequisite course work prior to their desired term of admission may apply to the Public HealthâUndecided (Pre-Public Health) program in the School of Public Health where they will then complete the remaining prerequisite course work prior to starting the major course work.  Current UIC students or transfer students from other institutions who will have completed all of the prerequisite course work prior to their desired term of admission may apply directly to the Public Health major in the School of Public Health. Note: The program will consider applicants to the major who have not yet completed PUBH 110: Public Health and Global Societies or their full foreign language sequence who submit a written request for prerequisite exception with their application.         Credit and Transfer Requirements         About Credits and Transfers   The Bachelor of Arts in Public Health is a junior entry program in which students acquire an array of skills that can be applied to many forms of inquiry, analysis, scientific and moral reasoning, and practice. Students interested in pursuing the BA in Public Health complete 60 hours ofÂ prerequisite course workÂ at UIC or another college or university and then if admitted to the program, an additional 60 hours ofÂ major course work. Admission to the program is selective and completion of the prerequisite course work does not guarantee admission.  Current UIC students or transfer students from other institutions who will have completed all of theÂ prerequisite course workÂ prior to their desired term of admission may apply directly to the Public Health major in the School of Public Health. Â As the major course work sequence begins only in the fall semester, students typically apply in the spring semester of their sophomore year for admission the following fall semester.  Current UIC students or transfer students from other institutions who will not have completed all of theÂ prerequisite course workÂ prior to their desired term of admission may apply to the Public Health – Undecided (Pre-Public Health) program in the School of Public Health. If admitted, students must then successfully complete the remaining prerequisites prior to entering the full major and beginning the major course work.
