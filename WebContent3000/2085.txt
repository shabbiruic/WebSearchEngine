The behavioral sciences form the theoretical basis for community interventions to enhance health and well-being.  Community Health Sciences offers four specializations in which students can focus their studies:Â  Community Health Interventions, Global Health, Population Health and Community-based Research Methods. The division also offers concentrations in Maternal and Child Health and Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology.    Learn more about this division         Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences   TheÂ Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences divisionÂ prepares students to protect the environment and improve the health of workers and the general public. Students learn to anticipate, identify and assess environmental and workplace health hazards, recommend corrective measures, institute programs to reduce morbidity and mortality, and evaluate these efforts. A highly inter-disciplinary area of study, Environmental and Occupational Health SciencesÂ students draw upon the fields of toxicology, epidemiology, engineering, industrial hygiene and other sciences to identify and control risks.  Specialized study is offered in: air pollution, industrial hygiene, water quality and health, occupational medicine, environmental chemistry, occupational safety, toxicology, occupational and environmental epidemiology and environmental and occupational health policy.    Learn more about this division         Epidemiology and Biostatistics   Epidemiology, the first of this division’s areas of focus, studies the distribution and determinants of disease and other health-related events in populations. Epidemiologic methods are used to establish links between risk factors and disease (e.g., diet and prostate cancer), clarify the distribution of disease locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally (e.g., global distribution of AIDS), elucidate the natural history of many diseases (e.g., cervical cancer), assess the effectiveness of public health interventions and evaluate health resource utilization.  Biostatistics is the development and application of statistical methods to problems in biology, medicine, public health and other life sciences. Professionals create solutions through management, analysis and interpretation of data, through study design and the acquisition of data analysis knowledge.    Learn more about this division         Health Policy and Administration   TheÂ Health Policy and Administration divisionÂ provides students with the conceptual and analytical tools needed to: analyze the implications of proposed policies; influence their formation; evaluate them once implemented; and manage private and/or public health care organizations so as to improve the health of the population. Â Students develop concentrations in health services research, health care administration, health policy analysis and public health informatics.
