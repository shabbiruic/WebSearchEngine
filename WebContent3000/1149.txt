The documents presented here are not a complete picture of every amazing program or impactful person who has graced our space, but they provide a glimpse of the past through the ephemera saved over the years. Today the LCCâs archives reside in three main places: the LCC office (see below), the UIC Library (see below), and this website. Increasingly over the past several years, the majority of our documentation has been born digital, so this is the best place to look for recent images, event posters, and other amazing publications.
