DrPH Student  Handbook       Required Courses (28 semester hours)    EPID 403 – Introduction to Epidemiology Principles & Methods (3 semester hours)  IPHS 501 – Public Health Leadership Seminar 1 (3 semester hours)  IPHS 502 – Public Health Leadership Seminar 2 (3 semester hours)  IPHS 503 – DrPH Integrative Methods Seminar I (3 semester hours)  IPHS 505 – DrPH Integrative Methods Seminar II (3 semester hours)  IPHS 510 – Leadership in Public Health Policy Development (3 semester hours)  IPHS 511 – Personal Leadership Development (3 semester hours)  IPHS 512 – Public Health Leadership Tools (3 semester hours)   Choose one of the following courses:   BSTT 401 – Biostatistics II (4 semester hours)  IPHS 514 – Quantitative Methods for Leadership in Public Health PracticeÂ (3 semester hours)  Or an equivalent course        Electives     Electives (minimum 8 semester hours)         About Elective Courses   Chosen from special topics courses, independent study and other course offerings, these credit hours allow students to build skills towards completing the dissertation. Courses are selected with the approval of studentâs Program Advisor.  Most UIC SPH 400-level courses may not be counted to fulfill this requirement. Some courses will be accepted if faculty agrees to add in assignments that cover the leadership relevance of the course. 400 level courses that are more technical in nature may be acceptable without the leadership component but may require additional assignments to raise the studentâs performance to the doctoral level. To meet these requirements, a DrPH student should first obtain permission of the course instructor along with permission of the student’s Program Advisor or DrPH Program Director or his designee.  To be counted toward the elective hours, relevance must be demonstrated in the Portfolio (described below). If the course is acceptable with additional work, the course instructor must agree to consider the additional work in giving the course grade. If requested by the course instructor, the student’s advisor (or DrPH Program Director or his designee) may assist in reviewing the supplemental paper. Review criteria for the additional work must be determined and agreed to by the course instructor and the DrPH Program Director or his designee at the beginning of the semester. Approval to count these courses toward the degree is part of the Program Proposal review and approval process.             DrPH Dissertation (minimum 28 semester hours)    IPHS 699 – DrPH Dissertation Project: The dissertation is intended to prepare students to contribute to the evidence base of public health practice. It can take a variety of forms, such as a traditional research study; an extensive intervention design involving organizational, system, or environmental change; an evaluation of a complex program or policy; or policy formulation and analysis. Most students require more than 28 hours of research to complete the dissertation.        Prior Master's Degree Credits   Credit for up to 32 semester hours given for previous masters of public health (MPH) or related degree. Incoming students without an MPH may be required to take additional foundational, core MPH courses. Although required for completion of the degree, any credits earned to complete MPH core course deficiencies and/ or the field practicum will not count toward the 96 semester hour minimum requirement for the DrPH degree. It is the studentâs responsibility to take and complete MPH-level courses at an accredited school of public health and request transfer of those credits to the UIC School of Public Health.       DrPH Field Experience (0-5 semester hours)   Required only for students without requisite experience upon matriculation.
