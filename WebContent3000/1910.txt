Restorative justice is both an end and a means to achieving a harmonious society. And where harmony cannot be restored because it has never been, restorative justice is a tool for discovering that harmony can exist in the community. Restorative justice techniques work on a personal level, as well as societal level.        Restorative Justice Program           Details   The Restorative Justice Project  The Restorative Justice Project (RJP) trains law students in restorative justice techniques, so that they become better lawyers. Students evaluate existing case law and statutes in light of restorative justice principles. Judges, attorneys, and other peacemakers offer their perspectives. The students go to the community where they observe court proceedings and visit a jail or prison so they can compare retributive to restorative justice approaches in actual practice. The students then put what they have learned and observed into effect by working with high school and elementary students in a neighborhood school environment.  Download Our Restorative Justice Brochure  Restorative Justice Course  InÂ Restorative Justice (TADR 476, 3 Credits) , students will discuss the basic concept of restorative justice and how it can be applied in specific areas of the law, including the treatment of persons who have been convicted of crimes, the mentally ill, drug and alcohol abusers, and juvenile offenders. Students will learn effective techniques on how to interview and counsel both victims and perpetrators. When appropriate, outside lecturers will be invited to discuss particular areas requiring specialized knowledge and skill. Restorative Justice is taught by Professor Michael P. Seng and Hon.
