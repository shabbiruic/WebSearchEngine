The UIC Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and the Programs for International Partnerships (PIP) office work together closely to offer the 3+2 Statistics program to students from partner universities and organizations, which includes a non-degree, two-semester undergraduate program, as well as Master of Science in Statistics degree.         First Year: Non-Degree Training Program        This program is designed for students pursuing Statistics- and Mathematics-related undergraduate degrees in their home universities.Â  Participants in this program will complete their final (senior) year of undergraduate study at UIC taking courses toÂ gain knowledge in the foundations of statistics and key technologies.Â The program is primarily intended to prepare them for graduate school in statistics and data science.          Second Year: MS Program in Statistics        Students who have successfully completed the first-year, non-degree program, as well as students holding a Bachelor degree from a reputable university, can apply for entry into the Masters of Science program.Â  During their graduate study, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the functional theory and key technologies in statistics with an emphasis on data science, while gaining practical, hands-on experience with statistics programming languages and big data tools through coursework and applied research experiences.Â  Through this program, the UIC Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, working with the Programs for International Partnerships office, offers a one year Master of Science in Statistics degree.  Please contact PIP to find more about contracted degree requirements, curriculum, and admission standards for the MS Statistics program.
