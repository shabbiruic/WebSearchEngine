We provide educational programs that affirm the diverse needs of woman-identified people on campus. We work to promote gender equity by raising awareness of womenâs and gender issues, developing womenâs leadership, celebrating womenâs accomplishments and contributions, and encouraging self-care and spiritual well-being.  WLRC houses theÂ Campus Advocacy Network (CAN) Â program, through which we offer resourcesâcrisis support, advocacy, education, trainingâto address interpersonal violence (sexual harassment/violence, stalking, domestic violence) in individual, community, and institutional context.  WLRC provides a welcoming, safe, and inclusive space for people of all genders that encourages dialogue and diversity. Come study, relax, and chat with us.         Staying Connected: Updates about COVID-19 and WLRC/CAN      March 31, 2020 Update:  For the duration of the Spring 2020 semester, WLRC (and all the Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change) will be physically closed. Some of our programming will be moved to virtual spaces.  Staff are working remotely and can be reached at wlrc@uic.edu . We will continue to stay connected with you through social media and email.
