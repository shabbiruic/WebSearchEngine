Interns will receive a $500 stipend per semester. Interns can also receive academic credit. Internships in good standing can lead to future employment opportunity with the ArabAmCC in future semesters.       Learning Outcomes    Expand knowledge of and fluency in Arab/Muslim and Arab/Muslim American communities and the issues impacting their lives in the region and in the diaspora, cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs.  Gain event organizing and outreach strategizing skills useful for all areas of work in a future career.  Develop general professional skills supportive for future careers including public speaking, data management, and meeting organizing and follow-up.  Expand critical thinking and problem-solving capacities.  Visit and learn from the other centers of the CCUSC to gain stronger cross-cultural understandings.        Structure and Requirements    Interns will be assigned a supervisor from ArabAmCC staff who will oversee their work and evaluate their progress.  Interns are expected to work 8-10 hours per week for 13 weeks per semester.  Interns may focus on particular projects but will also be participating in other aspects of the centerâs life and programming to grow their knowledge and skills in center logistics and events planning.  Interns can sign up for academic credit for this internship. Those interested can arrange it through their college. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences offers several opportunities for students to earn academic credit such as LAS 289.
