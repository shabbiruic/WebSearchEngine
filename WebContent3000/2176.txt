Urban Education students, as teacher candidates, benefit from working with some of the best education faculty in the world. They gain real-world experience through partnerships with carefully selected mentor teachers in Chicago communities and schools. Students spend their fieldwork-based semesters cultivating unique skill sets for success, working in schools with diverse student populations that are typically under-resourced.  The Elementary Education Concentration prepares students to become licensed teachers for grades 1-6, with the option to add a Middle Grades Endorsement (grades 5-8) across the major content areas (English/Language Arts, Math, Social Sciences, Science). In addition, students can pursue the endorsements in English as a Second Language and/or Bilingual Education. Graduates are job-ready because they are prepared to meet these areas of need.  The extensive in-school immersion, with nearly 1000 hours of fieldwork experiences, is an essential component of the program and prepares teachers to lead in classrooms from day one. Students begin their in-school work junior year.
