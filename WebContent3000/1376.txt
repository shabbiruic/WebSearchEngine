The goal of the Chicago competition is to promote literacy by encouraging the study of works by African-American playwright August Wilson. To participate, students perform a 2-3 minute monologue from one of the ten plays in August Wilsonâs Century Cycle. Around 500 hundred students participate annuallyÂ and aroundÂ 85% of participants areÂ of African-American or Latin descent. STM recognizes this opportunity to serve Chicagoâs underrepresented communities by encouraging participants to consider college enrollment and to provide support services that positively impact the retention and graduation rates of students of color.Â  For more information and downloadable applications please visit the August Wilson Monologue Competition website Â or call UIC Coordinator of Theatre Operations, Neal McCollam at (312) 996-3991.
