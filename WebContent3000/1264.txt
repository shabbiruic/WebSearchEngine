The DNP program is consistent with the American Association of Colleges of Nursingâs call to produce advanced nursing clinicians who are able to address complex care needs. In addition, it is supported by the National Academy of Science which has advocated for the development of professional practice doctorates as a route to advanced clinical work in nursing. The DNP is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).  The DNP degree curriculum at UIC consists of three domains of competencies for advanced practice in direct clinical care or systems: a) core practice competencies, b) specialty-specific practice competencies, and c) role competencies. Our mission is to develop advanced practitioners of nursing into evidence-based, intra-disciplinary providers who meet the needs of a rapidly expanding healthcare field.Â  The DNP requires completion of 60-97 credit hours (dependent on specialty focus), and can be completed on a part-time or full-time basis. Most students will complete the DNP degree within 3-5 years. The Doctor of Nursing Practice has multiple routes of entry. The program can be completed at one of our six regional campuses (Chicago, Peoria, Quad Cities, Rockford, Springfield, Urbana).Â  Â  The following specialty concentrations are available:   Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner  Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner  Advanced Population Health Nursing  Family Nurse Practitioner  Health Systems Leadership and Informatics  Neonatal Nurse Practitioner  Nurse Midwifery  Nurse Midwifery/Womenâs Health Nurse Practitioner  Pediatric Nurse PractitionerâAcute Care  Pediatric Nurse PractitionerâPrimary Care  Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner  Womenâs Health Nurse Practitioner   The DNP also has two affiliated supplemental c oncentrations.  Â A Concentration in Rural Nursing Services through the Rural Nursing Education Program (RNURSING) is offered as a part of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program for currently enrolled students. The RNURSING program includes elective course work to prepare DNP graduates to practice in rural communities and provides specialized interprofessional education and clinical preparation about rural healthcare and community-oriented primary care issues as well as the unique issues facing rural communities and rural health care delivery.  A Concentration in Primary Care Mental Health (PCMH) is offered as a part of the DNP for students in the six primary care specialties: family nurse practitioner, adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner, pediatric nurse practitionerâprimary care, nurse midwifery, nurse midwifery/womenâs health nurse practitioner, and womenâs health nurse practitioner. The concentration includes elective course work to provide additional academic preparation for the care of patients who present with common mental health problems that are within the existing scope of primary care practice, such as depression, anxiety, ADD/ADHD and substance use disorders. The primary care mental health concentration does not qualify students to obtain certification as a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner.  The Doctor of Nursing Practice at UIC is considered a professional program and is not administered by the Graduate College. Applications for this program are processed through the College of Nursing.Â  More information on the DNP program, admission requirements, and the application process is available online.Â          University of Illinois at Chicago   Apply Online | Contact Admissions | Privacy Statement Having problems accessing this site?
