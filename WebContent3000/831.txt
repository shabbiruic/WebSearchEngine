We collectedÂ the multimodal ELDERLY-AT-HOME corpus, where one assistant collaborates with an elderly person inÂ performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The project has focused on building a multimodal interface forÂ communication between the elderly person and the robot, since our data collection confirms that beyond language,Â gestures and haptic actions (gestures that involve touch) are pervasive in this sort of interaction. TheÂ corpus has been annotated for a variety of information and will be made available in due course. We have developedÂ a multimodal dialogue manager that performs multimodal reference resolution ( Chen & Di Eugenio, 2012 ),Â models the fact that these interactions comprise not only dialogue acts but also physical actions, and predicts theÂ next dialogue act on the basis of the preceding multimodal signals (Chen & Di Eugenio, 2013).
