DRC does not diagnose, but there are on and off campus resources that many of our students to work with clinicians to assess whether a disability is present if they suspect that they have a learning or mental health related condition.  On campus resources include:  The UIC Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI) which takes Campus Care and other insurance with a referral from a Primary Care Physician.  The UIC Office of Applied Psychological Services (OAPS) , an on campus community clinic which does not require insurance and provides therapy and assessment on a sliding scale basis.  For more information about local resources, download the DRC's Evaluation and Assessment Center list.  If you need any help navigating this process, please don't hesitate to contact the DRC to schedule an appointment, and a Specialist can walk you through your options and best next steps.
