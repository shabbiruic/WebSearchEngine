Other students on the waitlist will only be granted permission to enroll if there is space available after all pre-public health students have registered.  If departmental approval has been added to a 100-level Undergraduate Public Health (PUBH) course, UIC students seeking departmental approval may be granted permission to enroll if space becomes available by adding their name to the waitlist for the specific course. Please note that departmental approval has not yet been added to any 100-level courses so a waitlist is not yet available.     Advanced (300 and 400-level) Public Health Courses  Please review the information below on the waitlist process for 300 and 400-level Public Health (PUBH) courses:   Undergraduate Public Health (PUBH) courses at the 300 and 400-level are restricted to students in the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health Program in the School of Public Health (SPH).  If space permits, advanced undergraduate students pursuing a major outside of SPH who have successfully completed one of our introductory public health courses (i.e., PUBH 100, 110, or 120) may be granted permission to enroll by adding their name to the waitlist for the specific course available by clicking on this link .  Please note that if you intend to apply to the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health Program in the future, you should NOT request to take an advanced public health course prior to your admission to the program.
