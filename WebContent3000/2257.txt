Each student’s Annual Review will follow a program-wide template and each student’s progress will be reported to and discussed by the area faculty on an annual basis. One element on which students will be assessed will be their engagement in the scholarly community beyond coursework for the program. Students are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities for professional growth such as colloquia, conferences and preparing papers for publication. The Annual Review provides a structured occasion to examine each student’s participation in such professional activities.  Comprehensive Qualifying Examination  Near to or upon completion of required coursework, all students will be administered a comprehensive written exam as part of the requirement for qualification for the dissertation stage of the program. This examination will help students organize and focus their coursework toward dissertation proposal development and research. The comprehensive exam is individually designed for each student by the student’s program advisor and an additional 2 faculty members who compose a comprehensive exam committee. The committee members will together compose and approve questions for the student to answer. The questions will address the student’s general knowledge of the field of concentration, specialized knowledge within that field, and the student’s use of the methods of inquiry appropriate to research in that field. A student has two opportunities to pass all portions of the comprehensive exam to move to the next phase of the program.  Oral Preliminary Examination  After successful completion of the written comprehensive examination and coursework, a 5-member faculty committee shall be constituted to advise the student on the development of a dissertation proposal. At least 2 members of this committee must be full members of the Graduate College. One member must be from outside the student’s chosen area of specialization. This committee is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College on the recommendation of the department director of Graduate Studies. When the dissertation proposal is completed, an oral preliminary examination is administered by this faculty committee. The examination focuses on the substantive area of the student’s dissertation proposal as well as the proposal itself. The committee may require a written component to this exam.  Dissertation and Oral Defense  A dissertation of original research is required to complete the program. It must be defended before a faculty committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College on the recommendation of the department director of Graduate Studies. The committee shall have at least 5 members, of whom at least 2 must be full members of the Graduate College. One member must be from outside the student’s chosen area of specialization. This committee may be the same as the committee constituted for the preliminary examination.
