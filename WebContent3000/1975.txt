Local organization provides funding in support of artists with disabilities    The phrase âartist residencyâ may conjure images of an Italian villa retreat for painters or cabins in rural Vermont for musicians. Artist residencies are often held in remote locations so participants have plenty of quiet time to advance their craft. But for artists with disabilities, the possibility of securing one of these residencies isnât always feasible. There can be accessibility issuesâwill there be an ASL interpreter? Will a wheelchair fit into the small bathroom? Does funding include a personal care attendant?âbut the challenges go beyond access.  âWhile most artists need time away and isolation to give themselves space to work, the problem is that artists with disabilities are already isolated,â says DHD associate professor Carrie Sandahl.  The 3Arts Residency at UIC seeks to change that. This residency was inspired by a three-year research study on barriers and facilitators to arts careers conducted by Sandahl and Carol J. Gill, DHD professor emeritus, and is a collaboration with local nonprofit organization 3Arts. Led by executive director Esther Grimm, 3Arts supports Chicago artists with disabilities, women artists and artists of color.  Since 2014, funding from 3Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts has supported one to two artists with disabilities each academic year at AHS. The gifts support all costs of the residency, while UIC provides the artists with professional development, mentoring and resources.         Carrie Sandahl     We set up this residency to address some of the barriers we identified and connect artists with cultural institutions, as well as with disability culture and disability studies, Sandahl says. Thatâs why itâs at UIC.  This context also helps inform what the residency is not. Itâs not simply paying a guest lecturer to teach in a few classes. Itâs not a mechanism to teach audiences about disability. Itâs not for artists with impairments who are uninterested in disability culture.  âOur artists have to be willing to think about how disability influences their working process or their aesthetics,â Sandahl explains.  Apart from this requirement, the residency is intentionally openended, a luxury that the artists arenât always accustomed to.  âPrior to the residency, I was taking every opportunity I could and trying to make it work, which sometimes meant I wasnât totally thrilled with what I was putting out,â says artist Matt Bodett, the fall 2017 resident. Sandahl knows this frustration well from her own experience seeking grants to support initiatives like the residency. âI would have to warp my projects to fit the criteria,â she says.  Thatâs no longer an issue thanks to the generosity of 3Arts. Their thoughtful approach to funding means artists can dream big, while Sandahl can spend her time mentoring the artists, rather than cutting through red tape.           Matt Bodett     âThis is a foundation that really understands the research and sees how it affects a real-life problem,â she says. âThey came through for us.â  Sandahl emphasizes that itâs a relationship of trust, support and collaboration. She also says the funding arrangement is one that is fully replicable between other organizations and UIC faculty.  âIf thereâs a graduate or donor who has a particular affinity with an organization, I would encourage them to see who the researchers are at UIC in that same area,â she says. âForm those relationships and see what happens.â  Sandahl learned that anything can happen. Case in point, she couldnât have anticipated the global reach of the 3Arts Residency program. In addition to speaking at conferences nationally, Sandahl has presented on the residency in Canada, Germany and Switzerland.  Meanwhile, Bodett brought the performance art series he created during his residency to the Freud Museum in London and the No Limits Festival in Berlin. âThe residency gave me a new type of confidence,â he says. âIt made me realize that my only limitation is myself.â  Having recently moved to Chicago from Boise, Bodett was struggling to find his way in the Chicago arts scene before he started the residency. Heâs grateful that Sandahlâs mentorship and connections opened doors at the Poetry Foundation, Victory Gardens Theater and Steppenwolf Theatre.  âThe weight of what this residency represents in the community is very strong,â Bodett says. âIâm connected to the disability community and culture in a much more substantial and lasting way now.â           Reveca Torres     Reveca Torres, the fall 2018 resident, agrees. âThis wasnât a one-time transactional thing where you receive resources, write a report at the end and then theyâre done with you,â she says. âIâve become part of a community thatâs going to support me for a long time.â  That community even extends to students she met in Sandahlâs âDisability and Cultureâ course, which Torres audited during her residency. Some of those students have been volunteering with Torresâ nonprofit, BACKBONES, a network for individuals with spinal cord injuries and their families.  Other students have found mentors and advisers in the 3Arts Residency artists, as well as academic topics to pursue. âItâs been great for my studentsâ work and their research,â Sandahl says. âStudents are publishing and presenting about it.â  This speaks to the exponential impact of the 3Arts Residency. Thanks to the generosity of this foundation gift, AHS is engaging with people who are both familiar with and new to disability art and culture.  âWe are developing new types of work,â Sandahl says. âWeâre developing new aestheticsâ not only artistic choices but also techniques that are interesting to people all over the world. This partnership is helping to make that happen.â         Disability and Human Development              Admissions and Programs             Minor in Disability and Human Development    BS in Disability and Human Development             What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying             Transferring from another UIC program      After You Apply      MS in Disability and Human Development    PhD in Disability Studies             What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Faculty    Meet Our Students      Assistive Technology Certificate             What to Expect    Applying    Faculty    Assistive Technology Certificate FAQ      Disability Ethics Certificate             What to Expect    Applying        Institute on Disability and Human Development    Community Partners             Bodies of Work      Research Centers, Clinics and Community Programs    Continuing Education and Community Training    News    Calendar    Directory    Contact              Follow Disability and Human Development                                        College of  Applied Health  Sciences                                  Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts                                              UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
