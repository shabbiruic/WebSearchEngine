Events, presentations, and reports produced in conjunction with this project provide accessible data and analysis on how racial and ethnic groups in Chicago are faring in relation to housing, economics, education, justice, and health and are meant as a resource for the development of new engaged research projects and policy solutions. You can find our reports here.   In addition to our State of Racial Justice reports, IRRPP also undertakes research projects to analyze racial dynamics at the request of community partners. When doing so, we create a team of area experts who work closely with project partners to undertake the research and produce a report that creates greater knowledge about racial inequities and outlines policies that can help close those inequities. Find out more about our recent research project on CPS teacher evaluations here.   In addition to our research and reports, IRRPP provides funding to UIC faculty members who conduct engaged and policy-relevant research on race and ethnicity. Faculty Fellows are awarded course releases or a grant that covers research costs. Policy and Social Engagement Fellows are awarded grants for projects working with partners on a community action project. We invite you to learn more about our funding programs .   IRRPP focuses our funding on research that examines persistent racial and ethnic inequalities and advances social justice policy solutions. We also support engaged research projects in which UIC faculty and communities collaborate to create resources that sustain and enhance our communities.  Our Current Faculty Fellows   Brian R. Grossman, Disability and Human Development   Evaluating Cultural/Linguistic Access to Information & Referral on Family Caregivers   Over 5 million U.S. households include a person with limited English proficiency (LEP). Spanish-speakers are the largest LEP population, while Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese-speaking households report the highest rates of LEP. Despite an executive order to enhance linguistic access in all federally-funded services, disability services have been slow to address how to best serve LEP individuals and families, contributing to disparities in access and utilization. People of color, including those living in LEP households, account for one-third of all family caregivers of disabled people in the US. This project assesses state family caregiver services and support websites for information in languages other than English in order to generate a map to illustrate cross-state variation in linguistic access and compare access to demographic and linguistic need based on Census data.      Jennifer Jones, Sociology   Organizing for Inclusion: Immigration Politics in the New South   Most research on immigration and race looks at individual-level patterns or at macro-level political forces and laws. Missing from this is attention to the role that organizations play in racial formation. How are immigrant organizations constructing meanings of immigration, race, integration, and pluralism for the twenty-first century? This book project examines how and why immigrant-serving organizations adopt specific discourses about racial justice and immigration, and with what effects for political outcomes and racial formation. This study reveals that immigration organizations in the South articulate different visions of immigrants in America and different visions of racial change and progress. Some organizations advocate for systematic interventions to address the rigid racial system in the U.S. Other organizations present an idealized portrayal of immigrants that is divorced from any discussions of race. These distinct visions matter for political outcomesâopening the door for some political coalitions and closing the door for others.      Lynnette Mawhinney, Curriculum and Instruction   Teachers of Color in Activist Teacher Networks: Making Space for Racial Justice and Healing   Teachers of color are often pushed out of teaching due to experiences of racism and dehumanization in their schools and districts. This has contributed to the lack of diversity in the U.S. teaching workforce, in which only 18% of public or charter school teachers are people of color (U.S. Department of Education, 2016). This study examines the ways in which 26 teachers of color involved in activist teacher networks find support within and across these groups that sustain them professionally and personally. This book project examines how teachers of color developed unique, affinity-based support systems and spaces within their activist networks, which shared certain characteristics regarding ethos, network structures, and activities/tactics. Moreover, the book identifies the strategies that the activist networks used to support teachers of color within the broader organizations. These findings have important policy implications for supporting and sustaining social justice-oriented teachers of color in the profession.      Mahesh Somashekhar, Sociology   Racial Inequality between Gentrifiers? How the Race of Gentrifiers Affects Retail Development in Gentrifying Neighborhoods   Academic studies often link gentrification to racial inequality. Nevertheless, scholars know surprisingly little about whether the racial composition of gentrifiers moderates the consequences of gentrification. Few quantitative studies compare the effects of gentrification across different racial groups, and those that do tend to limit their outcome of interest to housing attainment. In this project, I examine how the racial composition of gentrifiers influences commercial development patterns in gentrifying neighborhoods. I combine U.S. Census data and nationally complete ReferenceUSA business directory listings between 1997 and 2014 to test whether rates of retail development are different in neighborhoods gentrified by middle-class Blacks rather than middle-class Whites. This project aims to advance research demonstrating that gentrifiers are not a homogenous group. There may be racial inequality between gentrifiers. Policy makers can use this research to promote racial justice efforts and equitable forms of economic development in gentrifying communities.      Pamela Popielarz, Sociology   A Whiteness Perspective on Organizations   Todayâs business world is fraught with racial/ethnic inequalities. People of color are under-represented in managerial occupations and as business owners. More broadly, legitimacy and success in business often seem to be equated with whiteness. This book project, tentatively titled Schools of Bureaucracy, sets out to explain how nineteenth century fraternal orders helped to create enduring racial/ethnic inequality in American business during and after the industrial revolution. The study mines a rich variety of documents produced by the Freemasons and the Knights of Pythias to theorize and empirically illustrate how patterns of inequality in one sector and one period can ramify across time and into other sectors.      Patrisia MacÃ­as-Rojas, Sociology & Latin American and Latino Studies   The Politics of Bed Space: The Privatization of Migrant Detention   In recent decades, free market business logics have reorganized the management of migration. Nowhere is this more evident than in the privatization of migrant detention. My project examines the privatization of migrant detention through a comparison of political struggles over the public and private management of detention beds. Drawing largely on a historical and ethnographic analysis of the (racial) politics, production and distribution of prison and detention beds, this project investigates when and how the private sector became involved in migrant detention. Global Commodity Chain analysis (GCC) provides a versatile framework to trace the politics of how goods or productsâin this case detention bedsâmove from production to distribution and consumption.      Sarai Coba-Rodriguez, Educational Psychology   Making Strides: School Readiness Among Low-income, Latino Families in Head Start   Research documents that Latino preschoolers are the least likely to be prepared for the transition to kindergarten when compared to their Black and White peers. Addressing current gaps in the literature, this project is to conduct in-depth qualitative interviews and photo-elicitation interviews with low-income, Latina mothers of Head Start preschoolers. Informed by a resilience framework, we explore the practices and beliefs of low-income mothers and the role of other family members in promoting childrenâs school readiness. Adding to our limited knowledge about the perspectives of preschoolers during this developmental stage, this project also plans to talk to preschoolers and learn their thoughts about kindergarten. These findings will add to substantive discussions of school readiness, resilience, and familismo. Further, our findings will provide insight for future workshops of how early childhood educators can capitalize on familiesâ funds of knowledge.      Torica L. Webb, Curriculum and Instruction   Pedagogies and Politicking: The Development of Civic and Political Awareness in Aotearoa New Zealand   This book project is an ethnography of the civic and political awareness and participation among MÄori youth in Aotearoa New Zealand. In the first half, I focus on the emergence of the MÄori cultural revitalization from the late 1980s-present. This includes advocating for school instruction in the MÄori language, expanding economic opportunities for tribes by suing the New Zealand government for reparations and investing the capital, and strengthening political participation of MÄori people that holds politicians accountable for improving MÄori lives. The second half of Pedagogies and Politicking situates the impact of these cultural, economic and political struggles on the civic and political development of MÄori youth by examining student experiences in school and familial contexts, tribal spaces, and political protests to underscore contributing factors and processes. This book contributes to ongoing conversations in education on how to use curricula and educational policy to increase young peopleâs civic and political engagement, and make democracy work for all.          Our Current Policy & Social Engagement Fellows    Brenda Parker, Urban Planning and Policy Community Partner: Cabrini Green Legal Aid  Developing a Sexual and Reproductive Health Workshop for Arab Youth in Chicago   This project will document and assess Cabrini Green Legal Aidâs client-led advocacy programs. Through these programs, individuals who have been negatively affected by the criminal justice system (via criminal records or incarceration) become community leaders and policy advocates. This model has initially shown significant transformative potential for participants, communities and policies. It aligns with Cabrini Green Legal Aidâs mission to âgive justice a voice.â It also fits with racial justice advocatesâ calls to support the resiliency, empowerment, and self-determination of individuals and communities impacted by prolonged institutional racism. A structured assessment will help Cabrini Green Legal Aid understand and document the effects of these client-led advocacy programs and hopefully garner resources to continue this work.      Elizabeth Todd-Breland, History Community Partner: Chicago Torture Justice Memorials  Chicago Torture Justice Memorials Oral History Project   Police violence against communities of color is a well-documented historical and contemporary problem in the U.S. and beyond. This faculty-community partnership will create an oral history project to address the legacies of racialized torture against Black Chicagoans under police commander Jon Burge between the 1970s and 1990s. In addition to documenting and preserving historical narratives of police violence, this community action project provides insight into how Chicagoâs 2015 policy of reparations for racialized state violence impacted the lives of survivors, their family members, and their communities. Chicago Torture Justice Memorials formed in 2011 to memorialize Chicagoâs police torture cases. Through a partnership between scholars, organizers, and survivors, this oral history project carries this mission forward, beyond the issuing of the reparations ordinance. The knowledge gained from this liberatory memory project will empower other communities to engage with the idea of reparations policy as a transformative means to address state violence.      Maria Krysan, Sociology & Institute of Government and Public Affairs Community Partner: Folded Map  Expanding Folded Map:  Engaging Hearts and Minds About Chicagoâs Segregation*   The purpose of this project is to expand on the powerful Folded Map project, which visual-artist Tonika Johnson has created. Folded Map is a visual investigation that involves photography and videography of Chicago residents and neighborhoods that reveals the inequity created by residential segregation. To expand Folded Map , we seek to create additional visual/videography content; develop social science-based content that can be infused into the Folded Map interactive website; and engage the more than 200 individuals who have expressed interest in becoming involved in the project. In so doing, we will combine the powerful message of artistry with social science data and research to help change the conversation about racial inequity by providing a more accessible window into the systemic causes and consequences of residential segregation. *Along with support from IRRPP, this project received funding from the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement.       Nicole Nguyen, Educational Policy Studies Community Partner: American Friends Service Committee  The Enemy Within: Countering the Criminalization of Muslim Youth in the United States   Drawing from an 18-month interpretive qualitative research study and ongoing collaborations with four community organizations, this project aims to increase public awareness of, and support public contestations over, national security policies that criminalize Muslim youth in the United States. Along with our community partner, the study will design and implement teacher workshops related to countering anti-Muslim racism and surveillance in schools; develop teach-ins that educate communities on shifting national security policies in Chicagoland; and create resources that support this political education, including teacher curricula, infographics, informational handouts, and policy briefs and reports.      Melissa Wagner-Schuman, Psychiatry and Pediatrics & Angela Shrestha, Clinical Instructor of Psychiatry Community Partner: Asian Human Services  Assessing the Mental Health Needs and Access Barriers for Members of the Korean Community in Relation to Others Across the Chicagoland Area   Current literature suggests that Korean Americans underutilize mental health services. Despite this, several studies have found that the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses amongst Korean Americans is higher comparison to other racial groups. Much of past research on disparities in Korean American mental healthcare access and utilization was completed in studies focusing on Asian American populations without separation of sub-ethnic groups. However, unique societal, cultural, and systemic differences influence interactions with the healthcare system, limiting the generalizability of previous studies. This study seeks to distinguish the mental health needs and access barriers specific to Korean American populations. To accomplish this, we survey the greater Chicagoland Areaâs Asian American community, focusing on Korean Americans and, along with community partners, we develop culturally sensitive initiatives and community centered solutions targeting identified barriers.
