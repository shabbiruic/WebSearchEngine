Engage in best practices in mentoring undergraduate research   The OUR values the work that you are doing in collaboration with UIC undergraduates, and seeks to support you as you grow in your your mentoring practice. Here are some readings that we recommend.   Mentoring Undergraduates in Research and Creative Endeavors , from Perspectives on Undergraduate Research and Mentoring Journal  Pathways of Support Webinar , Mentoring Underrepresented Students Webinar & Broadening Participation Resources Webinar, from Pathways to Science website  7 Key Ways to Make Student Mentoring Matter , from Inside HigherED  6 Tips for Effective Undergraduate Research Mentoring , from The University of Kansas Center for Undergraduate Research   To help facilitate clear communication and transparent evaluation processes, we recommend that faculty and students set up a research experience plan with the help of this template .         Fund your work with undergraduate researchers   Faculty conducting grant-funded research should contact their program officers to inquire about adding supplements to pay undergraduate researchers, for example through an NSF REU supplement, an NIH R25 supplement or through an NSF REU research site development grant. The Division of Chemistry for the Council on Undergraduate Research offers these tips .  Funding for your individual students to travel to conferences is sometimes available through professional organizations such as Council on Undergraduate Research , ARSC , Psi Chi , etc. To help your students apply for competitive external research fellowships such as the Fulbright, the Goldwater or the DAAD/RISE programs, refer them to the UIC Office of External Fellowships.  The UIC Office of Undergraduate Research can also provide UIC partners with data or student stories and is available to work with UIC faculty and staff and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research or UIC Advancement on grant applications and funding appeals centered on the high impact practice of undergraduate research.
