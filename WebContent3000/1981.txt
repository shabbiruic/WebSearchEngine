How does this ratio oversimplify the gender gap and exclude autistic trans and non-binary individuals? This webinar will provide an introduction to gender identity, discuss the intersection of autism and gender, dispel myths about âmaleâ and âfemaleâ autism, and share best practices for supporting autistic people of all genders.  Learning Objectives:   Provide an introduction to gender identity and gender justice.  Discuss the intersection of autism and gender identity.  Understand the impact of diagnostic bias.  Learn best practices for working with autistic people of all genders.
