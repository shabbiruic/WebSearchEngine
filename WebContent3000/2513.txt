The certificate program is ideal for students seeking an overview of public health informatics, whether public health professionals or students of traditional public health programs interested in a concentrated introduction to public health informatics. Candidates will specifically develop:   Proficiency in health data definitions and standards  Knowledge of the basic functions and operations of public health information systems  Ability to plan and manage public health information systems projects  Expertise to specify the requirements for the development or adaptation of publicÂ health information systems   The academic certificate in Public Health Informatics requires 16-19 semester hours (SH) and is designed for completion in three semesters (two courses each fall and spring semester and one during the summer semester), and must be completed over a maximum period of five years. Â A Certificate can be earned in 15 months; however, there is an accelerated Certificate option which allows for completion of requirements in 12 months.  Students completing Certificate coursework receive academic credit which may be applied toward an MPH if the student later pursues a degree.
