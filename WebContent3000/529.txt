After receiving a FAFSA the federal government determines a studentâs Expected Family Contribution (EFC), which will be listed on the FAFSA completion page and the UIC financial aid notification.  Important Note: The EFC is NOT the sum that a student/family will pay to the university. Exact costs for attending UIC are determined after a complete review of financial aid materials.
