The program is administered by the Department of Biomedical Sciences.  The Master of Science in Medical Biotechnology will train students in the major techniques and disciplines commonly used in biotechnology. Course subjects may include recombinant DNA and genomics, protein production and proteomics, biological systems, drug design and development processes. In addition, students will receive direct experience with many of the analytical and testing techniques used in the biotechnology and healthcare industries. Workplace-related training will include an introduction to pertinent regulatory issues and practices, basic training in proposal preparation and public presentation of technical topic and training in program management systems and product development processes.  A unique aspect of this program is the focus on biotechnology in medicine. Students are trained in the sciences and business practices important to biotechnology using medical applications. Scientists with industrial biotechnology experience, legal and regulatory professionals that serve the industry and practicing physicians will participate as instructors in the experience-directed course work and research activities.  Classes will also be offered in the evenings or weekends, thereby allowing students to earn their MS degree while still working full- or part-time.
