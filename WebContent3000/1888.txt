The field of law has changed a lot in the last decade. Clients require more customized services, international law impacts most areas of domestic law, and technology disrupts our field just as it does others. Itâs no longer enough to understand just the practice and theory of law. To fulfill your oath and responsibilities as a lawyer, youâll need to be flexible, proactive, and creative.  At UIC John Marshall, we prioritize skills training, and value diversity and inclusiveness. We believe in strong academics and making sure that you have strong professional development opportunities inside and outside the classroom. Weâve invested in passionate professors, a top-notch student life and leadership office, an excellent bar preparation program, and robust career support. And weâre literally changing the campus to meet the needs of tomorrowâs lawyers. But beyond that, weâll help you develop multiple skill sets, master life-long learning, and cultivate a growth mindset.  At UIC John Marshall, we want students who are engaged, empowered, and love to learn. We want critical thinkers who know their values and think beyond themselves. And we want graduates who are collegial, professional, and driven to make a difference.  Our mission is holisticâwe want to change your life, so you can change the lives of others. It starts the minute you arrive on campus. Every day weâll challenge you to practice excellence, but that challenge begins with a choice.  Choose UIC John Marshall.
