DEPTH         i                     Due to the COVID-19 pandemic UIC continues to accept undergraduate first-year and transfer applications for the Fall 2020 semester.            Application Fee Waiver Overview    All institutional graduate and professional applications require submission of the nonrefundable application fee or selection of an applicable waiver in order to submit the application.  Please see the applicable waiversÂ below. Waivers based on UI enrollment orÂ employment are verified by Admissions staff. Proof of other waivers (Illinois Veteranâs Grant award letter, McNair letter, etc.) is requested within the application.  Unfortunately,Â financial hardship waivers for graduate and professional applications are not granted.  Payment of application fees cannot be deferred.  Waivers do not apply between student levels: graduate degree-seeking, graduate non-degree, professional.  Fee waivers offered by third party centralized application services Â do not apply to the institutional/supplemental application fee, and waivers offered by UIC may not apply to CAS fees.Â         Graduate Degree-Seeking Level Waivers    Previous Graduate degree-seeking enrollment at UIC  Current Graduate degree-seeking enrollment at UIUC or UIS  Diversity Program Participation Waiver (eligible Ph.D. applicants only, click here for details)  Illinois Veteran's Grant recipient  Ronald E.
