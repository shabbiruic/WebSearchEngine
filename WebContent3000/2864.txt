Applications for our fellowships and grants are welcome from all disciplines across UIC. Junior faculty and faculty and graduate students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups are especially encouraged to apply.

Other Funding Resources Bi-annual workshops provide guidance on how to successfully search and apply for funding for research projects on race and ethnicity. Each workshop is targeted toward graduate students or faculty members. Watch these presentations and download the powerpoints for more funding insights.  The Visiting Scholar Program From 2012 to 2014 the Institute hosted a Scholar-in-Residence whose work   examines the policies, practices and ideologies that perpetuate racial   and ethnic injustice in the contemporary United States. This program   provided rich opportunities for the visiting scholar to exchange ideas   and develop relationships with UIC and Chicago scholars. Moreover, their   presence invigorated and enhanced the work being done at IRRPP and on   UIC's campus. For more details on this program, read about our former Visiting Scholars.
