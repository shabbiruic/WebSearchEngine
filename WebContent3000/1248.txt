All programs are taught by nationally renowned faculty and are accredited by AACSB-International. The MS in MIS is an advanced degree in the application of information technology to solve business problems. The program is designed to train future CIOs, project managers, and technology leaders. A student in the program may specialize in managerial, technical, or a combination of the two areas. Some of the leading-edge topics that will be covered in the program include business analytics, business process redesign, healthcare informatics, technology-enabled innovation, social media, supply chain management, enterprise application platforms, corporate IT management, information systems security, project and vendor management, and IT consulting.  The program is designed for professionals and students (a) in information systems who would like to gain advanced knowledge of the business use of information technology; and (b) in other business functions such as marketing, finance, and accounting who would like to use information systems effectively. The program is flexible and suitable for students with experience or education in information systems, business administration, computer science, engineering, healthcare, or other disciplines. A student may enroll full time or part time. A full-time student with adequate foundation can complete the program in a year. The MS degree is also offered jointly with the MBA, the MS in Business Analytics, and the MS in Finance.  The program leading to the PhD in Management Information Systems focuses on an interdisciplinary business understanding of how technology can affect an organizationâs behavior, structure, and function, and on the effective use, control, and management of information and computer systems. Both the technical aspects and organizational impact of information management are assessed. A faculty on the cutting edge of modern MIS practices ensures dynamic research and teaching possibilities in this field.
