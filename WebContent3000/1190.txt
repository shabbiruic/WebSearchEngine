The School also offers joint degrees in Architecture and Design Criticism.  Master of Architecture (MArch) :Â a three-year professional degree for applicants who have a bachelor's degree in any field. The MArch consists of a studio-centered curriculum supported by required and elective course work in architectural technology and theory. Applicants must have completed a calculus course and a year-long survey in architectural history or art history prior to enrolling in the program. See program websiteÂ for more information on the MArch .  Master of Science in Architecture (MSArch) : Â a one-year post-professional degree intended for applicants who already have a professional degree in architectureÂ or its international equivalent. The MSArch consists of studio-centered work in architecture and urbanism supported by electiveÂ course work in advanced technology and contemporary theory and criticism. See program website for more information on the MSArch .  Master of Arts in Design Criticism (MAD-Crit) : a two-year program that develops textual and visual argumentation in the areas of architecture, urbanism, landscape, and allied design practices. The MAD-Crit degree program is open to applicants with a bachelor's degree in any field. It is intended for postgraduate students and mid-career professionals who are interested in refocusing on research, writing, and publication. In addition to those with architecture backgrounds, the program is also suitable for those from other fields who are already practicing as critics, journalists, or curators and want to develop expertise in the design areas considered; or those who would like a terminal, graduate degree in order to pursue an academic career. Revolving around intensive writing seminars and publication workshops, the MAD-Crit program aims to solicit and expand the audience for design criticism and reposition the significance of design in public discourse. See program website for more information on the MAD-Crit program .  Joint degrees : Â The School of Architecture offers a four-year joint MArch/MAD-Crit degree as well as a one-year joint MSArch/MAD-Crit degree. These provide students with a greater range of opportunities in their pursuit of professional and academic careers.  a Required text from National Architecture Accrediting Board (NAAB): âIn the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Masterâs degree programs may consist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the preprofessional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.âÂ   Admission and Degree Requirements   Master of Architecture  Master of Science in Architecture  Master of Science in Architecture in Health Design (suspended)  Master of Arts in Design Criticism  Master of Architecture/MA in Design Criticism  MS in Architecture/MA in Design Criticism       ARCHÂ 414.
