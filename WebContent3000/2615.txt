AAANâs advising unit provides a comprehensive plan of services and programs to assist with the retention, persistence, and graduation of our scholars. AAANâs advising services are developmental and focuses on the unique interests, concerns, and needs of African American students. The AAAN Advising team also recognizes the importance of building strong partnerships with students and other stakeholders. Through college and program collaborations, advising will be enhanced by developing working relationships with the College Advisors and other on campus partners.  AAAN Advisors encourage student participants to create community along with a sense of ownership in their academic, personal, and social development.   AAAN Advisors assist scholars with identifying barriers to their overall success and develop a plan of action.  AAAN Advisors foster relationships with scholars, which enables them to increase their awareness of their own interpersonal and intrapersonal development, while becoming involved on campus.  AAAN Advisors aid scholars in identifying and clarifying their personal values, especially those related to scholastic achievement   Below you will find a list of offerings by the Advising Team:   Campus orientation programs  Assigned, individual advising  Academic Success Planning  Career and major exploration  Goal setting and effective decision-making assistance  Mentoring       Additional Resources        Liberal Arts and Science Advising          UIC Course Catalog          UIC Course Descriptions          UIC Summer School              Services              Educational Advising    Recruitment And Admission Assistance Team    The Learning Resource Center    Tutoring Services                         African American Academic Network         Second menu    Student Membership         Contact   Student Services Building, 1200 W Harrison Street, Suite 2800 (M/C 237), Chicago, IL 60607-7164  Phone: (312) 996-5040  Fax: (312) 413-7907  aaan@uic.edu        Social Media Accounts                         UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC Safe Mobile App  UIC Today  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        Powered by Red 2.38.0  © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield      Cookie Settings
