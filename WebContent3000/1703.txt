I made the decision to attend UIC because it was a respected University near my neighborhood that was affordable.Â All of the professors Iâve had are helpful and always willing to answer any questions outside of class. They all want their students to succeed and have a good understanding of the material. One important thing to me is that they are allÂ approachable which makes it easy for me to ask for help. The classes are a good learningÂ environment where all of the students respect each other. There are also many research opportunities available because I amÂ constantly receiving emails about new research opportunities that I can participate in.Â  Overall,Â Iâve had an amazing experience in LAS.
