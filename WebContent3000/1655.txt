Credentials   Credentials are a recognition of knowledge, skills, and experience that are awarded by the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS). Unlike endorsements, some credentials can be earned without obtaining an Illinois Professional Educator License (PEL).  Students should note that credentials are not a substitute or an alternative to a teaching license.
