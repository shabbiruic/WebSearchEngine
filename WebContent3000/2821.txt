Securable space for data collection servers and documents with study participant info.  Plenty of meeting space, including two large conference rooms — one formal, the other appropriate for workshops.  Many smaller meeting rooms for team meetings and participant conversations.  Offices for UIC researchers with IHRP-administered grants.  Offices and cubicles for their research teams.   Located in the Illinois Medical District, on the southeast corner of Wood Street and Roosevelt Road, the Institute is a five- to ten-minute walk from the intracampus bus , the Wood Street parking lot, the CTA Roosevelt bus (#12) and the CTA Pink Line (Polk Street stop).
