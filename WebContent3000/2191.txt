The program is in partnership City of Chicago Early Learning Scholarship Program . Following a course study, program candidates complete a two-year residency to earn an Illinois Professional Educator License (PEL) with an endorsement in early childhood education.       How to Apply & Eligibility   The application process is overseen by the City of Chicago, not UIC. To determine eligibility for the program, potential candidates must first complete the Chicago Early Learning Workforce Scholarship survey (linked below).  There are two intended recipients of this scholarship:   Current Chicago Early Learning program staff Â who are looking to increase their credentials.  Chicagoans interested in entering the early childhood workforce.   For Chicagoans who are not current early learning workers, applicants who are parents of children who are currently enrolled in one of Chicagoâs early childhood programs and individuals with financial need will be prioritized. Recipients must be eligible for employment in a Chicago Early Learning Center.       Course information (for current students)   Alternative licensure students work with UIC Extended Campus for course registration. If you are a currently enrolled alternative licensure student, course schedules are listed on the UIC Extended Campus website.      Survey:  Chicago Early Learning Workforce Scholarship       If you want licensure, but do not qualify for this program   If you are looking for an alternative licensure program for Early Childhood Education and do not fit the City of Chicago’s criteria, we strongly recommend you consider our Early Childhood Education master’s program . This licensure program is very flexible and designed to accommodate working students as well as people with no previous background in education.  With UIC’s traditional licensure program, you can get your license and an advanced degree in almost the same amount of time as an alternative licensure program, at a lower cost than private universities and without having to leave your current job.
