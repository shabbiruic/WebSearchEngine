The Office of External Fellowships help you explore the wide range of fellowship opportunities to determine which are best suited to your academic and career plans. Once youâve found opportunities that are a good fit for you, and vice versa, we advise you closely through the whole process, so that your application is as strong as it can possibly be.  Perhaps the most important recommendation for students pursuing any prestigious award is to get good advising.Â OEF can advise you on what makes a good candidate for a particular award, and on what makes an application strong and competitive.  A strong candidate may not be able to craft a competitive application without good advisement, and that is exactly why OEF is here!         1                Tell Us You're Interested!
