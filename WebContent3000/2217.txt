Strand A and Strand B in Science Education   The program is divided into two strands:   Strand A offers licensure for those interested in teaching high school science in an urban setting.Â With a focus on community relevance and social justice, it is unique among science teacher preparation programs nationally. Options include biology, chemistry, earth and space science, environmental science and physics.Â Strand A can be done as a one-year (full-time) or a two year or more (part-time) program.  Designed for already-licensed teachers, Strand B emphasizes science education in urban settings for teachers from early childhood through college, those working at, or interested in, not-for-profit science-related museums and organizations; or those seeking advanced studies in science, including those interested in eventually pursuing a PhD.        What makes the MEd in Science Education unique?       Focus on learning to teach and teaching in urban neighborhood public schools.        Emphasis on designing a content-rich and social justice driven approach to science curriculum.        Learning from community partners to become responsive to Chicago communities.
