A peer evaluation is part of a colleagueâs permanent file and submitted as part of the tenure and promotion dossier. The observation needs to be summative and evaluative.  The observation report should address as many of the aspects mentioned within the LAS policy and the department’s guidelines as possible. Observations should occur on the schedule set within the departmental guidelines, typically once per year prior to achieving tenure or senior lectureship, and every other year after.  Please send a signed or initialed electronic file to each of the following parties:   faculty member observed  department head  the School’s Assistant Director of Academic & Faculty Affairs.
