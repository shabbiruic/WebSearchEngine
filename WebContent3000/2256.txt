Students will have the opportunity to engage in critical, activist scholarship on diversity, equity and social justice in education. Coursework and research will equip students to conduct research from theoretical perspectives drawn from the broad field of Social Foundations.  This focused, yet flexible program allows students to pursue their interests related to how the social, cultural and political contexts of urban areas affect educational opportunities, especially for underrepresented and low-income children and youth. The program also focuses on change, education policy, and policy processes and their role in educational learning opportunities and outcomes.       Program Contacts      Nicole
