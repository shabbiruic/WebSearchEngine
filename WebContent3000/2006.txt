These awards tend to require a substantial amount of preparatory work. While many may perceive that some of the best-known awards, such as the Rhodes Scholarship, often go to students attending elite private institutions, this is nowhere near the whole story. UIC, along with many other state universities, has candidates who win these prestigious awards on a regular basis, and UIC students are competitive applicants for them each and every year.       1               Check out the fellowships                Sign up for the OEF mailing list             Preparing              Getting Started    Know Your Timeline                         Office of External Fellowships          Contact   601 S.
