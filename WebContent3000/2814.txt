Midwest Roybal Center  Tobacconomics   News                  Methodology Research Core    The Methodology Research Core provides statistical and methodological expertise to all UIC scientists affiliated with the Institute for Health Research and Policy.  The Core addresses research design and statistical analysis questions, including power analysis, missing data issues, longitudinal analysis, latent growth curve modeling, structural equation modeling, ROC analysis, psychometric analysis, and software development for multilevel modeling, among other scientific challenges.  The MRC offers access to standard statistical software such as SPSS, Stata, SAS and S-PLUS/R as well as more specialized software. Researchers usually consult the MRC as they begin to plan a study and develop a grant proposal. See " Guidelines for Including Biostatistical Support in IHRP Conducted Research Projects ."  This IHRP Core can contribute to plans for study design, sample size, statistical analysis and management of large or complex data sets, and other methodological issues.  MRC members often serve as co-investigators, focusing on methodological issues on specific research studies, and as consultants to other studies when needed. Familiar with the Institute’s research activities over the past decade, the MRC also facilitates sharing of innovative methodological approaches among research teams.  The Methodology Research Core offers strengths in both sound methodological expertise and knowledge of the social sciences.    Dr. Michael Berbaum holds a doctorate in psychology and has strong expertise in quantative methods and social sciences research.   Dr. Oksana Pugach , whose PhD is in biostatistics, began working on multidisciplinary research teams in graduate school.   Dr. Tianxiu Wang , who also holds a doctorate in biostatistics, began her career working on multidisciplinary research in the health sciences.   The Core's statisticians communicate substantively with behavioral scientists and construct sophisticated methodological plans for grant proposals that satisfy biostatistical review requirements of federal funding agencies.
