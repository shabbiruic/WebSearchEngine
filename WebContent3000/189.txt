My current work includes analysis of gains and losses due to undesirable activity on the Internet, investigating human factors in effective Internet security mechanisms, and building new technological primitives with the goal of increasing the practical security and privacy of Internet users.  I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively conversation regarding security research - please reach out via email or twitter if youâd like to chat!

This project helps us better understand the role of cleartext password emailing, the underground value of stolen accounts, and new ways to improve the security of sensitive, globally accessible information.   The CRISP project is building a new web front end language and paradigm to enable rich document publishing while providing greatly increased privacy and security over traditional HTML/JS/CSS based sites.  Our Harm Measurement research effort aims to characterize and quantify the damage experienced by victims of cybercrime.
