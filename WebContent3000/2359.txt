The MPH is directed toward students interested in public health practice and administrative positions. Enrollment can be on a full- or part-time basis. MPH students are admitted to the Comprehensive Program or to the Professional Enhancement Program (PEP) for experienced professionals with at least three years of paid public health or community health experience. This program can be completed entirely through face-to-face or online courses (see below) or a combination of these formats.  Students in the program complete a primary concentration, including community health interventions, community-based research methods, population health Â or as a community health sciences generalist. Â  Other primary concentrations require a separate application, including global health, maternal and child health, and maternal and child health epidemiology. Â Optional secondary concentrations include a range of interdepartmental concentrations from across UIC colleges.  The MPH in Community Health Sciences is offered as an in-person degree and as a fully online degree.
