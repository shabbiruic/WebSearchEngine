Please check back for updates.         LSRI was created in 2007 byÂ Susan Goldman , Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Education in UIC's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, andÂ James Pellegrino ,Â Liberal Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor and Distinguished Professor of Education.Â LSRI grew from the merger of UIC's Institute for Mathematics and Science Education, and a research program called the Program for the Study of Learning, Instruction and Teacher Development.  Today, LSRI is supported by the College of Education, the College of Engineering, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, whose Dean oversees operations.Â Located in the heart of Chicago on UIC's campus, LSRI is home to more than 130 staff, students, faculty and researchers.       What We Do     Teaching   Our PhD program a rigorous 5-year program that is fully funded so that students are able to devote themselves to full-time study.  We foster close advisory relationships between faculty and students. Graduates leave LSRI with a dual expertise â in the sciences of learning and in a discipline, such as chemistry, computer science, or literacy.     Identifying Challenges   We identify the critical challenges in education, literacy, mathematics, science and the social sciences, and we work to find solutions.  We focus on all learners, from child to adult, in schools, museums, and other settings where minds can grow and skills can be sharpened. WeÂ focus in particular on urban communities where school children have long been underserved.       Testing and Design   We design and test innovative interventions, models, toolsÂ and technologies to support teachers and studentsÂ in 21st century learning environments around the globe. Our “classrooms” break out of the traditional brick-and-mortar model because learning can happen anywhere.     Research   LSRI has more than two dozen active research projects fueled by more than $42 million in funding from state, federal and private sources. [examples and link]     Putting the Focus on Cognition   We focus on how the development of cognition can aid in the analysis and design of effective literacy, mathematics and science instruction, taking into account how the social and cultural dimensions influence learners and outcomes.Â We work to inform national education policy that supports those efforts.
