Make sure that your syllabus is in an accessible format.  All articles/handouts that are scanned into electronic file formats need to be accessible or easily converted to accessible formats.  Make sure when you adjust fonts from 12 point or larger, the document is still readable.  Are your PowerPoint slides accessible?  If using Tables. Make line-by-line reading sensible. Summarize.  Good color contrast is important for accessible documents.  Pictures and graphics must contain descriptions that can be read by a screen reader.  Content must have informative labels.  Check to see if course software, online homework and assessment tools are accessible with assistive technology.  Ensure that all instructional materials and web links are accessible before uploading and posting in Blackboard Learning Management System.  Videos used or created for instructional purposes must be accurately captioned and audio described.       Employ Universal Design principles when creating course materials .          Make sure that your syllabus is in an accessible format. An accessible format could be a Microsoft Word document or a PDF file developed accessibly from a Word document. For more information on creating accessible Microsoft Word documents go to:Â https://webaim.org/techniques/word/ For more information on creating accessible PDF files go to: https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/converting A Word document that is created accessibly will be able to be read using screen readers and also have adjustable fonts that can be enlarged for those who have visual impairments.     Go to Top of Document     All articles/handouts that are scanned into electronic file formats need to be accessible or easily converted to accessible formats. Underlying text of documents needs to be readable by assistive technology.Â  Â A description of the problem is atÂ https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat/pdf-repair-perform-ocr.htmlÂ Â  If text is skewed or characters are jagged, many times the document may not be accessible to people with disabilities.Â  Â  If you have a hard time reading a document, most likely assistive technology will not be able to read the text.Â  Â If you cannot select text with mouse by dragging your mouse over the characters, the document is most likely an image only file that is not accessible.     Go to Top of Document     Make sure when you adjust fonts from 12 point or larger, the document is still readable. Do not use fonts smaller than 12 point size.Â  Â Properly formatted files have scalable fonts that when you adjust the font size of a document from 12 pt. to 30 pt.Â  the document can still be understandable by people with visual impairments.

Go to Top of Document     Pictures and graphics must contain descriptions that can be read by a screen reader. Both documents and web pages need to have underlying accessible text. These documents include PDF files, Word documents, and web pages.Â  Webaim has a page concerning this process of adding underlying text:Â Â https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/     Go to Top of Document     Content must have informative labels.  When creating documents, please label with informative description.Â  Â File names and document titles need to include information including the course, unit, topic, and any other descriptor to insure the content is properly organized and received by the student.
