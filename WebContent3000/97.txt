For most students, the road to Expo begins in the Senior Design course , a two-semester sequence that allows seniors to gather all the knowledge and skills theyâve acquired at UIC Engineering and put them to work to solve a real-world design problem.  The projects our seniors take on range from the practical to the fantastic. Recent projects have explored creating biodiesel from coffee grounds, building devices to improve surgery, designing an HVAC system for a four-story building, conducting traffic analyses for Chicagoâs major highways, and recommending musical selections for people via facial-recognition technology.  Seniors enter their projects into the annual Engineering Expo, a conference-style event where students showcase their work to peers, faculty members, and panels of judges who represent Chicagoâs professional community. Beginning in 2019, computer science students also take part in Expo, exhibiting work they completed using Arduino.
