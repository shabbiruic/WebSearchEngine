Behm Co-Directors of Graduate Studies: Alan M. Diamond and Larissa Nonn Program Administrator: Sara Mata  Program Codes:  20FS1548MS (MS) 20FS1548PHD (PhD)    The Department of Pathology offers studies leading to degrees at both the masterâs and doctoral levels, but gives priority to doctoral applicantsÂ over masterâs applicants. Before applying to the Master of Science Program, students are required to consult the director of graduate studies . The department also participates in the Medical Scientist Training Program . The department is oriented toward the study of disease at the molecular, cellular, organ, whole organism, and population levels, using a wide range of approaches including epidemiology. Students are initially immersed in an integrated curriculum and later they complete specialized training in an area of pathology of their choice, including, but not limited to, cancer prevention, biomarkers of cancer, molecular and genetic epidemiology, tumor biology, and mechanisms of cancer development and progression. All areas focus on translational and transdisciplinary aspects of pathology, cancer research, and epidemiology.
