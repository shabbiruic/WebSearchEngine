The Center is especially invested in translating academic research and first-voice experiences of the diaspora into creative, informative, engaging and accessible formats. Utilizing exhibitions, film screenings, open-mic poetry gatherings, lecture-demonstrations, dance, visual and performing arts workshops, internships, storytelling projects, the Heritage Garden and other collaborative programs and initiatives, the African-American Cultural Center provides essential opportunities for UIC students, faculty, staff, and community partners to connect with a number of committed stakeholders.  A key element of the Center's approach is our ability to thoughtfully convene a diverse cross-section of individuals to humanize the experiences of people from seemingly different backgrounds through "hands-on" and embodied encounters.
