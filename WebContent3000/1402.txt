Team Challenge is an experiential program consisting of activities and low elements designed to help organizations improve communication, solve problems, build trust, and establish greater understanding and appreciation for all team members.       What To Expect?      Team programs are tailored to meet each groupâs individual goals and abilities. No two programs are identical! With the guidance of trained facilitators, groups participate in a series of physically and intellectually challenging activities that help identify various group dynamics. Immediately following each challenge, facilitators lead the group through reflection to evaluate and understand the activities. The entire experience creates a commonality amongst the group that lays the foundation for trust and commitment between team members.          What Are Our Goals?       Provide a fun environment for skill recognition and development  Enhance communication skills  Encourage the expansion of trust  Increase group cooperation and support  Foster a feeling of personal worth and accomplishment           Who Can Benefit?      The Team Challenge Program is designed to appeal to a wide variety of groups including but not limited to: UIC students, UIC faculty/staff, community and corporate groups. The program is not tailored to any particular groups. Our âchallenge by choiceâ philosophy allows participants to feel comfortable while contributing to the activity. Whether you are an established group or are just getting to know each other, the UIC Team Challenge Program has something to offer you.
