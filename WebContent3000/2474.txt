Our reach extends through leadership in federal projects, national / international collaborations, and our broad alumni and practice and research networks.  Our partner collaborations emphasize mutual learning, cultural humility, capacity building and sustainability. Prevention for both individual and community-level health promotion are at the center of our work and are demonstrated in our research, education, advocacy and policy efforts.Â  The inherent complexity of a community and population health improvement mission requires a lifecourse and ecological perspective, which informs our research, practice and education/teaching. Social justice is an overarching framework informing the ethos of our work; and we adhere to national principles of ethical public health practice and research.  Our work employs applied public health science. We effect change along a continuum of factors impacting human health, individual health related practices, family, and organizational change at both the policy and system levels.Â  Our work requires mixed methodologies and collaborations with traditional and nontraditional research partners as well as community stakeholders. Our applied focus involves translational research and leads to broad-based dissemination of innovative public health interventions. We also develop theories of health behavior and systems change. Our teaching mission includes partnering within academia as well as with practitioners to seek their expertise.       We impact community and population health by    Building capacity and enabling policies and systems to be more responsive toward advancing and protecting health and well-being.  Leveraging our diverse partnerships to maximize our impact.  Building and sustaining long-term relationships with communities  Improving community health through faculty, student and alumni leadership in practice, research and policy, directly translating science downstream to improve population health  Preparing graduates who are ready to apply public health skills and knowledge to effectively address community problems across diverse, multi-disciplinary contexts and settings  Developing, tailoring and disseminating evidence-informed health promotion interventions to prevent and address chronic diseases and enhance the quality of life  Developing, collaborating and contributing in policy and advocacy across multiple systems        About the Division Director      Dr. Arden Handler is the interim director of the Division of Community Health Sciences in the UIC School of Public Health, and the director of the Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health. Dr. Handlerâs research career reflects her long-standing commitment to improve the health of women, children and families, with specific interests in exploring the factors that increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and examining ways in which the health care delivery system, particularly how prenatal care, postpartum care, and preconception/interconception/well-woman care can ameliorate these risks. Other research and teaching interests include maternal and child health advocacy and policy, building the analytic capacity of the MCH workforce (MCH epidemiology), and the structure and functioning of the public health delivery system. Dr. Handler is a founding Board Member of EverThrive (formerly the Illinois Maternal and Child Health Coalition), co-chair of Illinoisâ subcommittee on the Social Determinants of Health as part of the Collaborative Improvement & Innovation Network to Reduce Infant Mortality (CoIIN), co-chair of the Postpartum Transitions subcommittee of the Illinois CHIPRA initiative, and member of the Secretaryâs Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM).
