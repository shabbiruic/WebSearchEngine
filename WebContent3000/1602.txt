Students must meet the minimum GPA requirement of 2.50/4.00 at the time of the application. Students must submit a request form online. Students must also consult their home colleges about acceptability and applicability of public health course credit toward their degrees.  Registration for public health courses is often restricted to students in the School of Public Health; therefore, students seeking a minor will need to consult with the public health undergraduate academic advisor to register for courses needed. A minimum of GPA of 2.00/4.00 for the 15 hours of course work is required to complete the minor.  For the minor, students must complete 15 semester hours as outlined below.
