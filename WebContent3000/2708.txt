The Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are autonomous and collaborating units committed to positive social change grounded in the principles of inclusion, access, and equity. Our collective purpose is to expand understanding of the value of cultural diversity and connect diverse assets to find creative solutions for common challenges. This driving theme draws upon the Centersâ expertise in scholarship and cultural engagement to provide relevant support to our specific populations on campus and opportunities for intercultural engagement among students, faculty, staff, and Chicago communities.  The UIC Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are committed to student retention through intercultural engagement, vibrant scholarship, mentorship, and dynamic community partnerships focused on socialÂ justice.Â  Through engaged-learning opportunities and ongoing acts of activism and advocacy, the Centers validate the lived experiences of historically marginalized students, thus welcoming them to be their full selves and improving their overall student success at UIC.
