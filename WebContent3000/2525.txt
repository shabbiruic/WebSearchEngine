Do you ask yourself how Chicago came to look like it does today, and what it might take for you to change it? Urban Studies students examine topics such as access to affordable housing and clean water, public spaces for everybody, efficient transportation systems, and how to create good jobs in cities. You will learn skills like making maps and designing presentations. You will learn tools to make cities âgreatâ and sustainable, and connect to people that can help you make change now and in the future.

I tend to then take my notes and work on assignments from my laptop. IÂ would advise my peers to use the greater amount of free time you have right now to fulfill a hobby or goal that you have been wanting to seek out. For me, I have always desired to work on language-learning on the side of classes and routines, and I am now more able to do so given the free time I have at home.”    Cyril Dela Rosa | "BA in Urban Studies 22"          “What is really keeping me positive is seeing the values of community, looking out for the most vulnerable and the working poor, peopleâs creativity in hard times, and working together to care for each other on full display. I came into this field with these values and it is a huge encouragement to see them across the world. Be kind and gentle with yourself and others. Be honest about your needs and abilities at this time. Keep laughing.â    Cassie Pettit | "MUPP 21"          “Like most people, I have made time in my day to video chat with friends and family. Connecting to others during quarantine has been key to my happiness. The situation has also made me appreciate the little things in life, such as having the time to make the perfect cup of coffee, working with the window open to get a fresh breeze”    Jenny Goldman | "MUPP 21"         Humans Of CUPPA       Go to slide 1    Go to slide 2    Go to slide 3    Go to slide 4    Go to slide 5                Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide                 Go to the next slide    Go to the previous slide               Explore CUPPA With Some Of Our Alumni:        “You realize that everybody wants to make the world a better place on paper, but this degree lets me take action. A CUPPA degree lets me move up in ranks but also apply it to more entrepreneurial pursuits.Â  I see just me being able to use the knowledge to try to affect proper change. Chicago is pretty set in its ways. Me having this knowledge and using it for the greater good — itâs going to happen.
