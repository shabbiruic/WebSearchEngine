More information  UIC Undergraduate Research Experience (URE)  When: Held annually, duration of the award variable Application Deadline: Summer prior to commencement of URE  About: The Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) is a university-wide program dedicated to fostering scholarly engagement and intellectual growth. The URE mission is to make research an integral part of the undergraduate academic experience at UIC by creating mutually beneficial research relationships between students and faculty researchers.  More information  Summer Research Opportunities Program For Undergraduates (SROP)  When: Held annually in the summer  Application Deadline: In the Fall semester, the Graduate College invites undergraduates to apply for participation in SROP. The student may apply to the program already having a research project in mind and a committed faculty mentor or simply by having a research area of interest. In cases where a student has an experienced interest but no mentor, the SROP staff will try to facilitate a match.  About: The Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) was first established in 1986 by the Graduate Deans of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC). The goal of SROP is to introduce domestic underrepresented sophomores and juniors to academic research experiences. Student participants work one-on-one with a faculty mentor giving them an opportunity to experience research and the graduate student experience. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) launched its SROP in 1986, with a total of six minority undergraduate students.  More information  UIC Student Research Forum  When: Held annually in April, this yearâs date is April 2nd, 2015 Application Deadline: March 15, 2015  About: The Student Research Forum represents one of the finest student-run activities at UIC.

The Forum provides a venue for students at UIC to present their scholarly efforts and is an event in which the campus celebrates the wealth of research across all disciplines carried out by the dedicated students of this campus.

Applicants are sought who have potential and interest in pursuing careers as education researchers, faculty members, or other professionals who contribute to the research field. The workshop, led by junior and senior scholars, will give fellows an overview of how education research is designed across fields, how quantitative and qualitative research methods are used in studies, and how research is applied to education policy and practice. Senior researchers and faculty from both academic institutions and applied research organizations (i.e., The American Institutes for Research, Educational Testing Service, the College Board, and the Urban Institute) will introduce education research as a field and share their area of expertise and knowledge with the fellows. Workshop activities will also focus on exploring graduate education, applying to graduate school, and beginning a career in education research.  Fellows will be paired with a faculty member and a graduate student who will serve as program mentors. In addition to attending the workshop, fellows will attend pre-selected paper sessions and presentations during the AERA Annual Meeting.  More information  APA Summer Science Fellowship  When: Held annually, this yearâs dates are June 13 â July 25, 2015 Application Deadline: Annually in February  An expenses-paid, intensive summer training program, the SSF places up to 12 talented students in the psychology laboratories of some of the most outstanding researchers in the Washington, D.C., area. The lab experience will be six weeks in length. The SSF program gives students an opportunity to explore the intellectual, personal and social processes of scientific inquiry and to experience cutting-edge psychological research through hands-on laboratory activities. SSF offers promising students the opportunity to equip themselves with skills essential to succeed in graduate school, and gives students who plan to pursue advanced degrees in psychological science the opportunity to be mentored by nationally known faculty.
