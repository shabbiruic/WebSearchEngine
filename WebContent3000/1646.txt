BA Human Development and Learning Â prepares students to become educators outside of the classroom, working with diverse groups of learners at any age: from early childhood to adolescence to adulthood.        *Application deadlines extended due to COVID-19   We have reopened the fall 2020 undergraduate applications for both first-year and transfer applicants. Understanding that plans for local students may be disrupted, we are an option for families that would now consider staying local. We do not have a fixed application deadline date, but we are Common Application exclusive for first-year students and that system will be taken offline for updates in late July.      Our programs           BA Human Development and Learning  Study early childhood to adult education,  with credentials and career pathways to work with diverse groups of learners             BA Urban Education - Elementary Education  Become a licensed elementary school teacher (grades 1-6, optional 5-8) in urban public schools          Application deadlines       First-year students  Application deadline      Early Action deadline  November 1    Regular deadline  January 15* (see extension info above for 2020)         Transfers to UIC       Transfer students to UIC  Application deadline      Fall semester enrollment  April 1* (see extension info above for 2020)    Spring semester enrollment  October 16         Inter-college transfer       Inter-college transfer student (already at UIC)  Application deadline      Fall semester enrollment  May 1    Spring semester enrollment  December 15          Need help or have questions about transferring credits?
