The central aim of the PhD in Rehabilitation Sciences program is to educate research scholars whose scientific focus broadly involves promoting function and preventing or reducing disability. This is achieved through ongoing mentoring from an interdisciplinary faculty that provides students with strong foundations in theoretical, methodological, and practiceârelated knowledge in focused areas of health and rehabilitation. Examples of professional and scientific disciplines contributing to the field of rehabilitation sciences include, but are not limited to, the health and rehabilitation sciences, social sciences, psychology, engineering, computer sciences, and other disciplines supporting mental and/or physical health. Programs of study incorporate instruction in the physical, occupational, social, cultural, and psychological understanding of rehabilitation and disability. Program faculty embrace both basic and applied research perspectives and seek to advance the translation of rehabilitation research into clinical practice and communityâbased settings. Students may receive training in areas of interest that include, but are not limited to neurorehabilitation, cardiovascular functioning and physical fitness, sensory and motor function, healthcare communication, assistive technology, telerehabiliation, rehabilitationârelated assessments and methodologies, biostatistics, communityâbased interventions, cultural diversity, and health disparities research.
