How do I apply for a joint degree program?   Joint degree applicants are required to apply separately to both programs, making sure to follow the application procedures/requirements for each program. We strongly encourage applicants to apply to one program at a time. We recommend applicants apply to their second program upon gaining admission and enrolling in their first program.  When applying to the second degree program, applicants are also required to submit the Change of Graduate Program form, with Section I completed.  We recommend that joint degree applicants work closely with academic advisors in both programs to insure proper sequencing of coursework and to assist in transferring application documents to the second application to avoid double submission of application documents.
