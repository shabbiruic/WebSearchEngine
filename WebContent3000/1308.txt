All students should contact the MS Program Coordinator who will explain the application process for MS CTS admissions.  For students applying to both programs simultaneously, MS CTS admission will be contingent upon both admission to the MD program and the support of the College of Medicine dean of educational affairs. Prior to admitting students into the MS CTS degree, HPA will check with COM to determine whether the student has been accepted into the MD program.  Admission to the MS CTS program will be determined based on the support of the College of Medicine dean of educational affairs, previous academic achievement, research potential, and commitment to CTS as evidenced by prior participation in clinical research.  In addition to other application materials, joint degree applicants are also expected to submit the following:  Letters of Recommendation Two required, one of which must be from a suitable clinical researcher who can attest to the applicantâs research abilities. Both letters of recommendation should address the following:  the applicantâs previous achievements in research and/or academics;  the applicantâs potential for successfully completing a clinical/translational research project;  analysis of the applicantâs career plans and commitment to research, and  how the joint degree would advance these plans.    Personal Statement Applicants will also submit a personal statement detailing accomplishments to date, and career goals and plans. Specifically, applicants should address background information relevant to their interest in clinical and translational research, and how additional training through the MD/MS CTS Program would help achieve these goals. The applicant should provide any prior or ongoing research experience and explain how this might interface with the joint degree program.   Degree Requirements  In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, students must meet the following program requirements:   Students in the program must satisfy the requirements of the MS CTS, a 48 semester hour program, and satisfy four years of the required medical degree program.  For the MS CTS, students must adhere to all relevant Graduate College policies, including minimum GPA and limits on transfer credit.
