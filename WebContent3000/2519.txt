Enrollment is prioritized for African American, Latinx,Â Native American and those committed to serving historically marginalized student populations. The goal of PMP is to strengthen the academic, professional, and social skills of new students as they enter graduate school. PMP curricula and competencies will be delivered in modules, and will be supplemented by professional development and SPH orientation services. Eligible PMP students will receive a stipend upon successful completion of the program.  The PMP curriculum is designed to introduce public health concepts and refresh your knowledge of quantitative methods, academic writing, and leadership development. In addition to the academic exposure, this is an excellent opportunity to get acclimated and form relationships with your future classmates.       Program Contact      Cecilia
