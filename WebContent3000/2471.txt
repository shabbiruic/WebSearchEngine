Celina Garza Interview     About Celina Garza's global health experience in Mexico         About Celina Garza's trip to Mexico   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC has made its greatest impact on you?  Through the Global Health Concentration I have been able to take classes that I otherwise may not haveÂ taken and challenges me to look at public health outside of the Chicago and US bubble. Through myÂ courses I have been able to meet students from various backgrounds and expertise areas. For example,Â through my global health elective course I have met students from the Human Development andÂ Disability department and it has been such an enriching experience learning from their perspectives.Â Additionally, through the Global Health Concentration I was more intentional about my field experience,Â ultimately having the opportunity to complete it at the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global health international experience?  In preparation for my international experience I researched Mexicoâs health care system and myÂ preceptorâs research topic areas. Additionally, I tapped into my peers and met with studentâs that hadÂ previously done their field experience at INSP.  3. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  Through my professional global health experience I learned that many of the issues we face here in theÂ US are also present in other countries and that is extremely important to be flexible in doing public healthÂ work. Regardless of where you are, it is always important to consider the communities priorities andÂ acknowledge their expertise and recommendations. I learned that I really enjoy being out in theÂ community and having face time with community members. This is one aspect I will definitely look forÂ when considering future professional opportunities.  4. What advice would you give to current global health students?  It is really important to do your research on possible field experience opportunities early on because someÂ programs may have limited space for students or have early deadlines in January or February. I wouldÂ also encourage global health students to look for their global health elective course outside of SPH, it canÂ be really refreshing to take a class that might be a little out of your comfort zone with new peers.  5. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  From my experience, I gained a greater perspective on how challenging it really is to make sustainableÂ change, and that just because you have people on your side, you may still need to overcome legalÂ frameworks to get things done. I am glad that these challenges did present themselves during my fieldÂ experience because I have a more realistic view on what actually needs to happen before change canÂ happen.  6. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  As mentioned before, this experience showed me that I really enjoy being out in the community andÂ talking to community members. As a Community Health Sciences student that is interested in community based practitioner research, I knew this was the case,Â but this experience cemented that I do want to just work behind a desk. Additionally, this experience hasÂ also kept my interest in evaluation work alive as it was clear that there were many organizations workingÂ towards the same goal, but doing work in silos with limited evaluation data.             Karis Barker Bio        Karis Barker, MPH in Community Health Sciences student, traveled to Canada through the Global Health concentration and completed her practicum experience with the Elizabeth Fry Society, where sheÂ confirmed her passion for addressing the public health disparities that marginalized ethnic and racial minorities face.          About Karis Barker's Global Experiences     About Karis Barker's global health experience in Canada         About Karis Barker's practicum experience   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC has made its greatest impact on you?  The Global Health Concentration at UIC has impacted me by challenging me to think about how I should apply public health frameworks and theories that I am learning in classes that are more locally/nationally focused to more global/international contexts.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global health international experience?  When thinking about how I prepared for my global health international experience in Canada, my relatives were beyond generous in providing housing, food, and a bike for me to use during my practicum. I also had the advantage of completing my practicum in a country that I am pretty familiar with and whose language and culture are similar to mine here in Chicago. The biggest challenge was figuring out my bike route for commuting to the office and getting the best deal on a plane ticket to Calgary.  3.Â What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  Starting work at the Elizabeth Fry Society, I was self-conscious about my lack of practical experience working in a public health setting but I made the decision to approach the experience with a posture of humility and learning, which served me well. In short, I learned how to be a good learner, especially when it came to matters of Indigenous customs and traditions. Instead of trying to hide my ignorance or pretend that I knew more than I did, I took the opportunity to ask for context and guidance.  4.Â  How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  My perspective changed as a result of my practicum experience primarily by increasing my awareness of Indigenous people. I learned about them in school but they remained a distant, abstract population until I worked with my Indigenous colleagues at the Elizabeth Fry Society. Knowing Indigenous people as individuals, as friends and co-workers with unique life-stories enhanced my understanding of their cultural heritage and history as well as my interest in learning more about the health disparities that Indigenous people endure.  5.Â In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  Working for the Elizabeth Fry Society of Calgary validated my interest in pursuing a career conducting research and evaluation. It also confirmed my passion for addressing the public health disparities that marginalized ethnic and racial minorities face. After learning about the intergenerational trauma that Indigenous people living in Canada experience, I have added this population to my mental list of potential research topics. My experience also compelled me to seriously consider pursuing a career in Canada.  6. What advice would you give to current global health students?  For the current global health students that are beginning to think about their practicum experience, I would implore them to start searching for opportunities as soon as possible. I started actively searching in January and didnât have a promising option until April. Even still, the logistics were not settled until mid-May. Practicum applications were a source of immense stress for me and many of my peers, especially as we got closer to the deadlines.  The process of preparing for the practicum experience is long; it is important that you give yourself enough time to apply for and consider multiple options, including time for completing paperwork after deciding which option you will choose.  I also offer the advice of Vincent van Gogh: âI am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it.â Donât let lack of experience hold you back. As long as you demonstrate your willingness and desire to learn, I have found that people are equally willing to teach you, or at least guide you towards better understanding. This is particularly important in global health contexts.             Carrie Nacht Bio        Carrie Nacht, MPH in Epidemiology student, completed her field practicum in Kisumu, Kenya during summer 2018, during which she realized that she wanted to pursue a career in international epidemiological research. Â She says she benefited from her experience byÂ improving her quantitative analysis skills and learning new statistical analysis.          About Carrie Nacht's global health experience in Kenya     About Carrie Nacht's global health experience in Kenya         About Carrie Nacht's practicum experience   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC has made its greatest impact on you?  The Global Health Concentration is impactful because the courses that you take are very insightful on everything that you do in your global professional experience. It helps âset the sceneâ for what global work entails.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global health international experience?  Talking to previous students who have done this field practicum gave a lot of insight, even after doing a lot of searching the internet for things to pack, what to wear, etc. Hearing someoneâs perspective who has gone through the same thing is really crucial.  3.Â What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  The global professional experience provided me something that I wouldnât have been able to discover without enrolling at UIC: what I want to do with my life! I figured this out while pursuing my field practicum in Kisumu, Kenya this summer, which is where I realized that I want to do international epidemiological research for my future career. Being in that setting and seeing this research being conducted firsthand made me realize that there isnât anything Iâd rather do!  4.Â  How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  Every time I go to another state, country, or continent my perspective changes. And I actively try to pause during daily activities and look at my perspective, whether it be a regular Tuesday during a semester at UIC, or during my global experience. As Marcel Proust once said, âThe real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.â  5.Â In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  This is a really good professional experience for me because I could improve my quantitative analysis skills and I learned a new statistical analysis software. Additionally I got to observe all aspects of global research, including field work, collaboration, data work, and lab work.  6. What advice would you give to current global health students?  Reach out to people you are interested in working with for your practicum early and often.             Sara Stokes Bio        Sara StokesÂ completed her fieldwork in Kisumu, Kenya, where she learned about overcoming public health challenges that surface at the global level and how local culture influenced the environment she worked in.          Q and A with Sara Stokes     About Sara Stokes' global health experience in Kenya         Sara Stokes' Thoughts on her Global Health Experience   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC has made its greatest impact on you?  The greatest impact that the global health concentration has had on me was the ability to participate in the Kenya program this past summer. Through this opportunity I was able to fully realize my passion for global health and the impact that I can have in this field.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global health international experience?  I did a few different things to prepare for my experience in Kenya. I explored the culture and what languages they speak. I also did research on their political environment to see what was happening currently and in the past and how it has shaped the city.  3. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  The most valuable thing that I learned was how to overcome challenges that sometime present themselves while working on a global scale. Things that we take for granted here in the US such as getting supplies can become a month-long process in another country. I also learned about how local culture influence the environment you work in as well.  4. What advice would you give to current global health students?  I would tell them to take advantage of all the opportunities that the global health program offers. I would have never gone to Kenya and been able to travel around to surrounding countries had it not been for the Kenya program.  5. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  My worldview has changed drastically from going to Kenya. I have realized that different is not so scary. There is so much to learn about the rest of the world and if you only take what you hear in the news and take it as absolute truth then you are missing out on valuable cultural experiences and overall understanding.  6. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  This experience enhanced my goals of working in a more global arena. Â I have realized how I can work in another country without necessarily having to live there full time which can be a bit intimidating. I also learned about the multitude of NGOs that operate on a global scale and was able to learn more about those organizations.  7. What advice would you give to current global health students?  I would tell them to take advantage of all the opportunities that the global health program offers. I would have never gone to Kenya and been able to travel around to surrounding countries had it not been for the Kenya program.             Meghna Nagam Bio        Meghna Nagam, MPH Community Health Sciences student, completed her fieldwork teachingÂ sexual reproductive health classes in Bolivia, solidifying her desire to pursue a career in global health, including enrolling in theÂ UICâs College of Medicineâs Global Medicine program.          Q and A with Meghna Nagam     About Meghna Nagam's global health experience in Bolivia         Meghna Nagam's thoughts on her experiences   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC has made its greatest impact on you?  Being able to work with students and faculty who are extremely dedicated to global health and having the space to be able to talk about worldwide health disparities and strengths has been my favorite part of UICâs Global Health Concentration. Whether it was through the Global Health Solutions class or International Night, the community I joined here has had the greatest impact on me.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global health international experience?  Since I was going to being spending 6 weeks in Bolivia, I spent a lot of time practicing my Spanish speaking skills and brushing up on medical vocabulary because I was teaching sexual reproductive health classes. I also prepared for the designing and evaluation parts of my practicum by going through the readings and assignments that I completed through my community health sciences curriculum to begin creating a list of sources that I could easily access during my time abroad.  3. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  I think the necessity of being flexible when it comes to public health work was the most valuable thing I learned through my global professional experience. No matter how much planning goes into a program, thereâs always the chance that you wonât have the materials you need or even the turnout you expected for a program. Learning how to quickly adapt to these situations while still valuing the community and culture you are working with is extremely important for ensuring long-term success of a public health intervention.  4. What advice would you give to current global health students?  Keep in mind that a project you want to pursue is not necessarily what the community actually needs. I would advise current global health students to be open minded with what health areas or geographical locations they want to work with. Even if a project isnât 100% what you originally planned on working on, the ability to apply what you have learned through your public health coursework in a real-life setting is an incomparable experience.  5. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  Teaching sexual education classes was something I had done in America before, but I assumed it would be vastly different in Bolivia. While there were definitely cultural and societal differences, there were also a lot of similarities in the questions students asked, topics they wanted to learn more about, and areas that made them uncomfortable. This really opened up my eyes to how despite being in different hemispheres, teenagers in Bolivia and the United States shared a lot more in common, especially in relation to their sexual health, than I originally thought.  6. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  This experience truly solidified my goals of being a public health practitioner in a global setting. Because of the global health concentration and my experience abroad, I decided to join UICâs College of Medicineâs Global Medicine program and train to become a physician who is also focused on tackling global health disparities.             Sayuri Fujita Bio        Sayuri Fujita, MPH Health Policy and Administration student,Â traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel during the summer of 2017 to participate in a global health course and Applied Practice Experience at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.          Q and A with Sayuri Fujita     About Sayuri Fujita's global health experience in Israel         Sayuri Fujita's thoughts on the fieldwork experience   1. In what ways did you prepare for your global health practicum in Israel?  During my global health practicum preparation, I got in touch with my Practicum advisor to prepare my participation in the practicum experience. I acted in accordance with the rules, regulations, and professional standards of our University, Ben-Gurion University, the partner institution in Israel, and the field practicum site. I made sure I followed up with Alyson and Erin, coordinators of the Global Health Concentration at UIC, my academic advisor, registrarâs office, and financial aid office. I made sure I filled out all the necessary paperwork and turned it to the coordinators of the academic institutions, my academic advisor, financial aid adviser, and the consular officers. Lastly, I made sure I had enough funds to support me during my time abroad.  2. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global health professional experience?  Overall, the most valuable thing I have learned throughout my global health professional experience is to always stay true to myself, follow my passion, and always remember to care about others and the environment. I learned a lot more about myself abroad because of the unique space in which I learned, experienced, and time spent exploring another culture. I was able to examine my worldview and it challenged any assumptions about myself and others.  3. What advice would you give to current global health students?  My advice to current global health students is to take the opportunity to study, work, live, do research in a cross-cultural environment, and be able to contribute meaningfully to real-world needs through community service-learning. Taking an opportunity to go abroad allows students to come across unexpected adventures and enables students to rely on their social skills and knowledge. Students are allowed to choose and decide their own field practicum experience based on their ability and skills. Supervisors, who serve as hosts, assign roles based on studentâsâ aptitude and readiness, and they help develop and coordinate types of fieldwork placements for students.  4. How did your perspective or worldview change as a result of this experience?  My global health and field practicum work abroad has heightened my worldview, mainly because I was able to make sense of the countryâs history, culture, traditions from my own eyes and from my own experiences. I was able to fulfill so much more understanding about the peopleâs health, well-being, and livelihood, including their deep history and cultural diversity. Being abroad reinforced my worldview and I was able to fully grasp that we are all different, yet we are all different, as we come from different backgrounds and experience different hardships. I have learned to embrace and appreciate the differences of others and encourage others to thrive, leading us to a more understanding of rich cultural society.  5. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  My global health study and field practicum work in Israel has truly enhanced my personal growth, skills, and experiences. My experience abroad enhanced my career goals because I am willing to follow a path towards a career in global health whether it may be at a national or international level in international development, philanthropy, humanitarian aid, or diplomacy.             Jenny Guadamuz Bio        Jenny Guadamuz, MS Health Policy and Administration student, traveled to Amman, Jordan in 2016 toÂ intern with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, where she performed a field study to gather information in the use of antihypertensive medications and hypertension control among Palestine refugees in Jordan. Â Jenny was also a recipient of the Douglas Passaro scholarship.          Q and A with Jenny Guadamuz     About Jenny Guadamuz's global health experience in Jordan         Jenny Guadamuz's fieldwork experiences   During her time at the School of Public Health, Jenny was involved in research of medicines to prevent and treat chronic illness with Dr. Dima Qato from the Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes, and Policy at the College of Pharmacy. Dr. Qato recommended Jenny for this position and supervised her research project.  1. In what ways did you prepare for your global practicum?  Before I left for Amman I tried to learn as much as I could about the Jordanian culture. Expats can save a lot of headaches if they can avoid the most common faux pas. This being said, culture shock will always occur when youâre in a new culture. Thankfully, Jordanians are among the kindest people one could meet. Colleagues, neighbors, and even strangers all helped me navigate Amman; both physically and socially. The most important thing is to be open to the help your new community is eager share! (Most are also eager to learn about Americans.)  2. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  As clichÃ© as this might sound, the most valuable thing I learned during my experience was to be open. Open to what? Help, criticism, and differing perspectives. I spent weeks studying the UNRWA health delivery system. But within a week in Amman I had a completely different and deeper understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of the system. I even had to redesign my proposed study given the on the ground realities. Â I could only have gained that knowledge by listening with an open mind.  3. What advice would you give to current global health students?  Find a good advisor. I met Dr. Qato in 2015, after I took her class because I thought her research was interesting. She saw that I had a true passion about health equity and equitable access to medications and she helped me gain research experience with her and always has new ideas about how I can improve as a student and researcher. Her network even helped me get the internship in UNRWA. A good advisor is invaluable for all global health students.             Nicole Laramee Bio        Nicole Laramee, MS Health Policy and Administration student, completed her fieldwork in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 2016, building a sustainable business scale-up model for a neighborhood-based disaster risk reduction program created by several UIC colleges and implemented in Haiti in 2012. Â Jenny was also a recipient of the Douglas Passaro scholarship.          Q and A with Nicole Laramee     About Nicole Laramee's global health experience in Haiti         About Nicole's fieldwork   Nicole traveled to Port-au-Prince, Haiti during the summer of 2016 to complete her university field practicum. Nicoleâs main task, along with the help of a colleague from the University of Illinois and Chicagoâs Liautaud Graduate School of Business, was to find a sustainable business scale-up model for a neighborhood-based disaster risk reduction (DRR) program that had begun its work in Haiti in 2012 â a collaboration of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) School of Public Health, College of Business Administration, College of Medicine, and Center for Global Health.  Nicole was able to learn how to create a project plan and lead the conduction of an in-country partner assessment, the creation of formal business proposals, and the execution of multiple business presentations. She was also able to learn how to use differences in both culture and expertise in advantageous, efficient, and effective ways; learn the basics of the Haitian Creole language; and observe the conduction of a one-week community disaster risk reduction (DRR) training lead by GTRRID (Gwoup kap Travay pou Rediksyon Risk ak Dezas), UICâs local, in-country disaster risk reduction training partners.  1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC made its greatest impact on you?  The Global Public Health Challenges course (IPHS 409) was a great course that provided me a solid foundation in both past and present global health issues while also challenging many of my preconceived notions about global public health and what it really means to be culturally competent and meaningfully involved in global health work.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global practicum?  I did a lot of reading on Haiti in an attempt to gain proper insight into and context of Haitiâs complex (and honestly quite tragic) history and the factors responsible for where the country is and how it is functioning today. Mountains Beyond Mountains, The Uses of Haiti, and Farewell, Fred Voodoo are some great ones. I would also recommend to anyone either thinking about or preparing for global health work to read any article(s) by Paul Farmer in relation to poverty and global health, such as âSocial Scientists and The New Tuberculosisâ â he does a great job of relaying the important differences between the effects of poverty (as well as other large scale structural factors) and those of culture (and therefore cultural competence) and the trouble that results from mistaking the effects of one for those of the other.  In addition to my background reading, I also took some time to learn the basics of French, one of two main languages spoken in Haiti and one of the languages by which Haitian Creole (the other main language spoken in Haiti) was heavily influenced. I also had the good fortune of being able to travel to Haiti on multiple occasions with my preceptor and architect behind the project, Dr. Janet Lin, to get my âfeet wetâ in certain aspects of the project and to meet those involved.  3. How did this experience prepare you for work in public health?  This experience allowed me to do just that â experience. It allowed me to really envelop myself in the culture and the context in which policy and business happen in-country and my colleague and Iâs efforts were made more fruitful because of it. You cannot truly begin to understand a nation, nor develop sustainable programs that seek to improve the status quo, until youâve experienced first-hand what that status quo is. An understanding of this will make me a more adept and effective health policy analyst.  4. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  While I have numerous professional goals and interests that I would like to pursue within my lifetime, the goal which I am most passionate about and the one which I am most dedicated to both pursue and accomplish is that of writing global public health policies that will get better health care access, treatment, and education to resource-poor nations. My experience in Haiti has, without question, influenced this goal for the better by confirming my passion for global health work, enhancing my leadership capabilities, and by providing me with an increased sense of cross-cultural understanding and humility that I could not have acquired back home.  5. What advice would you give to current global health students?  If you are on the fence about doing your field practicum abroad â do it! An experience in global health will equip you with skills that are simply not possible to acquire domestically. And be flexible! Tis the nature of global health work for plans to change and change often â be able to roll with the punches. Flexibility is a great skill to have and something good will always come out of it!             Mary Otoo Bio        Mary Otoo, MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics student,Â worked with an organization called Unite For Sight to provided free vision care and eye restoring surgeries for residents in rural Ghana in 2016. Â Her responsibilities on the field included recording patient information, performing visual acuity tests, dispensing medication and eyeglasses as prescribed by the local doctors, and coordinating referrals for surgeries.          Q and A with Mary Otoo     About Mary Otoo's global health experience in Ghana         About Mary's fieldwork   Mary worked with an organization called Unite For Sight to provided free vision care and eye restoring surgeries for residents in rural Ghana. Her responsibilities on the field included recording patient information, performing visual acuity tests, dispensing medication and eyeglasses as prescribed by the local doctors, and coordinating referrals for surgeries. In addition to these, she used a tool provided by UFS to survey mothers and explored the association between maternal perceptions of child eye problems and non-receipt of eye care in the life of their children.  A previous student had told Mary about her volunteer work with UFS in Ghana which got her interested in volunteering but she never had found the opportunity to do it. The MPH practicum requirement provided Mary the opportunity to do something that she had been interested in while satisfying her requirements for school. Mary was also eligible to apply for scholarships to fund her experience.  1. In what ways did you prepare for your global practicum?  I learned and familiarized myself with the language and culture of some of the communities I was going to work in. These helped me to be mindful of pitfalls and avoid being too intrusive when I surveyed patients for my study. I also shadowed and trained with doctors for skills that enabled me to effectively assist with work on the site. Unite for Sight courses also provided the necessary background information to understand and recognize various eye diseases.  2. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  I learned about the importance of sustaining programs so that impacts are maximized over a long period of time and not just at an instant or short time frame. Secondly, I learned that to ensure the continued success of a program, it is utterly important to involve the community e.g. local doctors in planning and decision-making. Lastly, results of any research performed in a community should be communicated back to the community for their benefit and improvement.  3. How did this experience prepare you for work in public health?  This experience provided the opportunity to apply skills essential for a career in public health. Through my research, I was able to attain IRB approval, apply survey techniques in collecting data on the site, employ epidemiological methods in analyzing collected data and disseminate results of my study through oral and poster presentations at conferences. Additionally, my practicum exposed me to the realities of health care delivery in resource-limited environments. I learned how to make do with limited resources and effectively deliver healthcare services amidst language and cultural barriers. I learned how complex global health problems are managed using financial and human resources.  4. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  The crowds of varying ages who attended UFS outreaches each day was baffling. This made the extent of vision problems evident and further emphasized the need for eye care in Ghanaian communities. I was impressed by how local doctors worked around the clock to care for patients. They worked until the last patient had been seen during outreaches and some surgery days went on until about 11pm, when over 50 patients, some bilateral, had received cataracts surgeries. This was amazing! I was also impressed with the community effort in keeping UFS outreach programs sustainable. I had previously wondered, âWhat are they doing to help themselvesâ and was happy to have witnessed a whole team working to reduce the global burden of blindness and vision impairment.  5. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  My practicum experience definitely gave me the feeling of being part of something meaningful and has reinforced my interests in global health, public health, and vision health. This is because I got hands-on experience in applying public health principles to blindness prevention in a global setting The impact of cataracts surgeries was almost immediate that along with patients, I could appreciate the outcome. The best part for me was to witness patients look around as if it was their first time seeing and grateful for the gift of sight.             Richard Peyton Bio        Richard Peyton, MPH in Maternal and Child Health student, worked as the recruitment and retention liaison and programs director at Anza Mapema, a study under the Nyanza Reproductive Health Society, in Kisumu, Kenya. Anza Mapema, which loosely translates to Early Start, is a program that aimed to recruit 700 men who have sex with men for participation in an HIV prevention/treatment program.          Q and A with Richard Peyton     About Richard Peyton's global health experience in Kenya         About Richard's fieldwork   Richard’s fieldwork was assisted byÂ generous funding from the UIC Maternal and Child Health Center of Excellence and through participation in the School of Public Health’s Kenya Program, which provided room and boarding with a host family.  What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC made its greatest impact on you?  Having access to leaders in their respective fields made it easy to choose UIC and the Global Health program. Because of those global connections, I was placed in Kenya for the summer, and additionally, I was able to pursue research that is relevant to populations that align with my research interest.  1. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  I learned that Pubic Health really is everywhere. In the School of Public Health, we teach Health in All Policies, but seeing this in action, on a global scale was a great experience. On one of the beaches in Kisumu, there is a weekly beach party. Seeing Health Advocates at the party talking, mingling and handing out condoms and lubricants, was a great interplay of community based health.  2. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  I have traveled extensively around the world and as such, I would not say that my worldview changed. However, my worldview was re-enforced by witnessing the cask systems that exist even in poorer communities abroad. There is a lot of work that needs to be done to bring equity to the world. Iâm excited to continue on this path.  3. In what way did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  I was originally a bit hesitant about this opportunity because I did not think that working with the MSM community aligned with my MCH concentration. However, I was able to see the impact of marginalized populations regardless of sexuality or gender identification. This has led me to look more broadly at upcoming employment opportunities. Instead of looking for a pure maternal health job, I know that by working in family health, marginalized communities, or other aspects of community health, will still have a lasting impact on maternal health.  4. What advice would you give to current global health students?  Strike out and try something new. As Iâd mentioned, I did not think this experience would fully align with my career and education goals. However, getting on the ground, I found a way to link this experience to my education goals. Additionally, you never really know when another chance will come to do something amazing.             Noreen Sarhene Bio        Noreen Sarhene, MPH in Health Policy Administration and MBA student,Â completed her practicum in 2016 with IMA World Health, a non-governmental organization in Washington, D.C. that offers sustainable and efficient solutions to health-related problems, including providing medical supplies, fighting diseases and strengthening health systems and womenâs empowerment.          Q and A with Noreen Sarhene     About Noreen Sarhene's global health experience in Washington, DC         About Noreen's fieldwork   Noreen was hired as a Business Development Intern with IMA World Health, and this was a paid experience. Noreen was interested in working in the headquarters of a NGO because she aspires to work behind the scenes in a managerial/operational role while providing ground support when needed in a global health context.  Noreen’s term at IMA provided her extensive experience in the proposal acquisition process and the associated regulations and guidelines. In this position, she was integral in the organization of the proposal process and interpreting and communicating proposal requirements to ensure compliance with external consortia and consultants in order to fulfill donor requirements. Additionally, she had the responsibility of backing partner development and management efforts. With regards to the organization of the proposal, Noreen was tasked with duties such as formatting CVs, conducting background research to determine the practicality of pursuing upcoming opportunities and collecting the necessary proposal components from different departments in order to submit a final product.  1. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  The most valuable thing I learned was how the entire global health field works. I obtained a greater understanding of the players in the game and the role that each player plays. I gained a better understanding of how I could formulate and combine my skills to prepare for a career in global health. Lastly, I learned where I could use my strengths to make the greatest impact on communities abroad.  2. How did this experience prepare you for work in public health?  This experience prepared me for work in public health by helping me to understand what kind of organization I wanted to work for and what I ideally would like to do within that organization that best complemented my strengths. It also allowed me to understand my gaps in knowledge and how to best mitigate these gaps by either improving on certain skills, increasing my knowledge base or networking with professionals in the positions I saw myself in.  3. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  I realized that we live in a globalized world whether we choose to see it or not; even aspects of the world that are seemingly unrelated to the U.S. effect the U.S. and its stakeholders and it is in our best interest to keep America as an integral participant in global health. I no longer believe that there is a disassociation between public health and global health. Global health embodies the essence of public health, primary prevention. By assisting developing countries today we are preventing mass disasters tomorrow.  4. What advice would you give to current global health students?  The advice I would give to future global health students is to take every opportunity to learn everything and network with people in the field. It is okay that you do not know everything in the moment but, if you continue to be curious and engaged you will learn everything you need to to be successful. Be sure to soak up as many skills and knowledge as possible so you will not walk into a situation ignorant; however, be assured that it is okay if you stumble and fall from time to time. Patience, perseverance and determination will take you a long way.             Ariel Trocino Bio        Ariel Trocino, MPH in Health Policy and Administration student,Â worked with the Ministry of Housing and Social Development in Grenada, honing her skill set in addressing global public policy challenges.          Q and A with Ariel Trocino     About Ariel Tracino's global health experience in Grenada         About Ariel's fieldwork   Ariel was grateful to receive funding from the UIC Global Health Program, and she self-funded the remainder of the practicum. She was interested in continuing her experience in Grenada after accompanying a group of School of Public Health MPH students to do work with the Ministry in Grenada during spring break.  1. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  While there are many things I learned about applying public health principles on the ground while in Grenada, perhaps the thing I learned most was flexibility and adaptiveness. International work requires good listening, thoughtful engagement of stakeholders and the ability to change course at the drop of a hat. If I had expected the same working environment I had in corporate America, my experience would have been far less rich and rewarding. Being flexible on the ground while working in international health is an excellent skill I am glad I learned while in Grenada.  2. How did this experience prepare you for work in public health?  Working in Grenada gave me the confidence to believe I can be a public health professional. Though I have been out of school and working for many years, public health was a career change for me. Before arriving in Grenada, I did not consider myself all that knowledgeable and skilled. Working with the Ministry and the people of Grenada made me understand that I am bringing a specialized skill set and framework to public policy challenges, and I have something important to offer in any room.  3. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  Working abroad helped me realize that the world is much smaller than it feels when you stay in one place for a long time. I have traveled in the States, but living abroad for the summer helped me understand that I am capable of being flexible and adapting to new cultures and environments. An important part of this understanding is learning that wherever you go, people are friendly and kind, and we all want the same things. The world feels significantly smaller and less unknowable because of my experience in Grenada.  4. In what way did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  Prior to going to Grenada, I did not plan to consider policy positions that had an international or global focus. I feel I have broadened the job opportunities open to me because of my international experience.  5. What advice would you give to current global health students?  My advice would be to remain flexible about where your practicum may take you and advocate for yourself. There are so many professors in all the divisions that have global experience; email them or stop by their offices and ask for a meeting. Talk to everyone you can about wanting to go abroad and what practicums may be a good fit for you. There are so many connections to be made and experiences to have!             Kathryn Vivirito Bio        Kathryn Vivirito, MPH in Epidemiology student,Â completed her practicum in western Kenya with the Kenya Medical Research Institute on a One Health program. The program focuses on the connection between human and livestock health within rural communities in western Kenya and offers free medical care for families and their livestock in the study. Â Kathryn was a recipient of the Douglas Passaro scholarship.          Q and A with Kathryn Vivirito     About Kathryn Vivirito's global health experience in Kenya         About Kathryn's fieldwork   1. What about the Global Health Concentration at UIC made its greatest impact on you?  The connections that I have made while at UIC are some which I hope to maintain throughout my future career. Many professors have extensive global health experience and are more than willing to mentor students and help navigate the program. Learning about the work that professors at UIC have accomplished abroad is both inspiring and humbling, and I hope to apply everything I have learned from them throughout my career.  2. In what ways did you prepare for your global practicum?  I think the most important preparation I did was to talk with second year students who had also gone abroad for their practicum. The were very honest about what to expect (and what not to expect). Learning as much as I could about the project and culture beforehand was also very helpful.  3. What was the most valuable thing you learned through your global professional experience?  Learning how to adapt in different settings and be resourceful when in the field was a great learning experience for me. However, I think the most important thing I learned was the importance of clear communication and expectations when working with projects both abroad and here in the U.S.  4. How did this experience prepare you for work in public health?  I learned a lot about project implementation and working in a developing country. Working with livestock in rural Kenya offered invaluable insight into the importance of One Health and the major obstacles faced.  5. How did your perspectives or worldview change as a result of this experience?  My experience abroad allowed me to take a step back from the classroom setting of global health and apply what I had learned in real life. Until I was able to apply my knowledge and witness what we had learned about first hand, I did not have a full grasp of the challenges of international public health work.  6. In what ways did this experience enhance or change your career goals?  My experience abroad solidified my desire to work on One Health projects in developing countries. I Â plan to use this experience to tailor my veterinary career and maintain a strong interest in global One Health experiences.  7. What advice would you give to current global health students?  When searching for a practicum, be sure to keep your options open and start early. Utilize the connections that UIC has to offer to find an opportunity that fits you. While abroad, remain flexible and adaptive. Few practicums go as smoothly as planned, but remember to get the most out of your time abroad- it goes faster than you think!            2009-2014  Global Impact Stories          Global Health              Global Health Concentration    Global Health Faculty    Scholarships    Our Global Impact    Travel Blogs              School of Public Health  UI Health                        UIC's seven health sciences colleges and health care delivery enterprise.
