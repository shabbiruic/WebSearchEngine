In Their Own Words           “My passion for data and insights began during high school when I was working on a project on the milk supply pattern of my locality which encompassed thousands of households. My curiosity got the best of me, fast forward a few years and I ended up pursuing a master’s in economics, wherein my understanding of data-driven business grew and I also learned its immense importance. My transition to analytics as a whole has been a gradual and smooth ride, influenced by my work at Capgemini where I was a consultant with Data Science and Analytics team. UIC provided me the best possible MSBA program which matched my background and catered to my requirements. It helped me develop sound technical skills along with knowledge of business concepts.
