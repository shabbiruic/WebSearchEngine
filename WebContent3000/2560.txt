In 2018, the Education Advisory Board (EAB) ranked Public Policy as the 15th most valuable major out of 162 degrees.Â Researchers evaluated majors based on graduatesâ unemployment rate, average salary, and the number of graduates with a post-secondary degree. Out of the top 15, Public Policy is the only social science major listed. Read moreÂ here  Policy is just a fancy word for “rules”. From schools, to parks to your own workplace, policies determine what can (or cannot) be done in a particular space. From administrative policies to ordinances and laws, weÂ trainÂ you toÂ locate,Â understandÂ andÂ analyzeÂ the policies thatÂ impactÂ you, your family, community, state, nation and world.  Who is a good fit for our program?   We like to think of our public policy program as an âappliedâ political science degree. Students who are curious about why bad policies are perpetuated, how to fix them, at what level of government is there opportunity for positive change, and the role of non-profits in transforming democracy are an ideal fit.  Highlights of our core program:   Values-driven public service training means that we encourage all our students to have a vision about what a high-functioning democracy should look like  Analytically grounded training gives you concrete skills to take directly into the workforce, and soft-skills and leadership development to help our students work in highly collaborative environments  Experiential learning opportunities in-class and through field placements at some of the top government agencies and non-profits in the city, state or nationally  Real opportunities, real careers to help transform our democracy!

I believe that every Professor brings a unique style of discipline that can be used by individual students (if attentive) to craft a vast repertoire of theoretical and experiential knowledge in this field.    Benjamin Brown | Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy Student          “The classes I took at the College of Urban Planning & Public Affairs (CUPPA) provided the conceptual foundation for approaching key policy issues, and giving us the tools to change or dismantle policies using values of equity, transparency, efficiency, and accountability. At CUPPA I found a chosen family that are all dedicated to making this world a better and sustainable place. I will forever be grateful for my experience at CUPPA because they helped me to elevate and empower my voice.”    Sief Salameh | Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy Student          Admissions   New first-year students interested in admission to the BA in Public Policy program must apply using the Common Application and be admitted by the Department of Public Administration, College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs.
