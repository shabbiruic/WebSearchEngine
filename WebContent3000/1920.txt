Campus Safety & Security officers, while enforcing UIC John Marshall Law Schoolâs regulations, are authorized to ask any person for identification to determine whether individuals have lawful business at the Law School and can initiate a citizenâs arrest when reasonable grounds, other than a City of Chicago ordinance violation, has occurred.
