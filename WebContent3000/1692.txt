However, many LAS students elect one in order to enhance their educational experience.  The following is a list of minors offered directly through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.Â  For a complete list of all minor options offered at UIC, visit theÂ Degree Program and Minor List Â in the UIC Undergraduate Catalog and consult with the College offering the minor for the most accurate information.
