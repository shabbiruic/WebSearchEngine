The ID Center can help you find the proper accessories.  We can also work with you to create a custom badge. Despite many optionsâ ID Center name badges are very affordable for all departments. There is a nominal setup fee for the design of your badge. This fee starts at $125 with minimal increases for various customizations. This is a one-time fee.

From those in suits to those in uniform shirtsâ badges add a professional identity to your department.       Customer Service   In todayâs environment where customer service is as important as everâ let your customers know who theyâre working with by utilizing name badges. Customers should be able to be certain that theyâre being assisted by an employee of your department. Customers should easily know your staffâs names in the case that exceptional service is provided or a problematic situation arises. Badges help eliminate confusion for your customers.       Security   Some departmentsâ especially those in secure areasâ can provide an added layer of security by requiring that their staff and authorized personnel wear name badges while working. Customized name badges provide an easy way for fellow staff to determine if someone is in an area they arenât supposed to be.       Quick Production & Simplicity      Some departments on campus already produce their own similar name badges.
