As climate changes and water resources are stressed, the economic, geopolitical, and health impacts on society are becoming more evident. Our research in climate and water science includes land-atmosphere interactions and the global water and carbon cycles; chemical reactivity of water with other Earth materials; dynamics of coastal environments with changing climate; and, synthesis and modeling of large datasets that address human impacts on water resources and ecosystems.

Our work includes synthesis of field data and databases obtained by remote-sensing, as well as numerical modeling of motion and heat flow. The evolution of the U.S. Mid-Continent rift, formation of crusts on icy planetary bodies, and cratering of the Marsâ surface are some of the processes currently studied.

Our research uses geochemical, biological, and statistical analyses of biomarkers, fossils, and microbiota, along with experimental simulation of extreme environments to study lifeâs origins and evolution. Terrestrial study sites range from landfills to Yellowstone hot springs, Illinois to the Philippines, and ancient rocks to the depths of Antarctic Lakes. Current experimental simulations are focused on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.

Our research in this area is developing and includes application of isotopic tracers for forensics work; trace metal and organic pollutant analyses in soils, water, air, and fish; and, analysis of relevant data for weather patterns and climate change.

The Department also has established partnerships with public high school students and teachers, and with community college faculty, through various education research grants.
