By adding this requirement, financial-aid-eligible students may complete a Budget Increase Form to cover the purchase of laptop (not a desktop computer), up to $2,500. Students must complete the form, attach a copy of their receipt, and submit the information to the Financial Aid Office. Request the budget increase before purchasing the laptop. Budget Increase Forms are available in the Financial Aid Office. Please contact anelson@jmls.edu if youâre not able to pick up a form on campus. A budget increase for a laptop may be granted only once during a studentâs law school career. Also, to qualify for financial aid support, your laptop must meet minimum performance specifications, which, along with FAQs, are available at ITS Computer Buying Guide. To qualify, laptop purchases must be made after August 1, 2019 to be valid. Students are encouraged to consult with Anita Nelson, Executive Director of Financial Aid, before purchasing a laptop, to ensure that the purchase will qualify for the budget increase. Funds for the budget increase will be disbursed directly to your student account. Any outstanding balances or debt owed to the law school when the computer loan is issued will be subtracted from the loan; the law school will then refund the remainder.
