Serving as student advocates, advisors are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to assist undergraduate student advisees with university and college degree requirements, general education requirements, and academic policies and procedures. In addition to your assigned advisor, each LAS student will work with departmental advisors to explore major and minor programs of study.  LAS undergraduates participate in academic advising throughout the entirety of their undergraduate degree, whether it be required programming or elective visits. Remember to check your university email for important notices and outreach from your LAS academic advising team!
