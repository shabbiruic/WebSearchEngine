Cabrera, PhD, Director         Rosa Cabrera, PhD, Director, she/her/hers      She / Her / Hers  cabrerar@uic.edu   Rosa M. Cabrera became the director of the Rafael CintrÃ³n Ortiz Latino Cultural Center at UIC in the spring of 2011. She earned her Doctorate in Anthropology and Bachelors of Arts in Design from UIC. Cabrera has talked extensively on the role of ethnic museums and cultural centers in shaping community identityâwhich was the topic of her dissertation. Prior to joining UIC, she was at the Field Museum where she led the âCultural Connectionsâ program, a partnership of more than 25 ethnic museums and cultural centers in Chicago that formed the Chicago Cultural Alliance in 2006 under her leadership. Between 2009-2011, she was part of a research team in a project with nine Chicago neighborhoods to better understand how diverse residents, including Latinxs in Pilsen could be engaged in the Chicago Climate Action Plan.Â  At UIC she has implemented projects such as the Heritage Garden to help the campus make explicit connections between environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, and social justice. She is currently working on the Humanities Action Lab “Climates of Inequality” project, which includes a traveling exhibit that amplifies local stories of environmental justice. The local story ofÂ La Villita , developed by UIC students in partnership with Alianza Americas, reveals how environmental injustice, immigration, and policing intersect in this neighborhood.  Cabrera is affiliated faculty with the UIC Department of Anthropology, Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS) Program, the Graduate College, and Museum and Exhibition Studies (MUSE) Program. She is also a Keller Science Action Center Associate at the Field Museum. Her research interests include: the role of museums in civic participation and community identity formation; Latinx identity and citizenship; the intersections of environmental/climate justice and immigration; and the role of the arts to increase public dialogue on pressing social and environmental issues.  Cabrera is a first generation college graduate and a 1.5 generation immigrant from Cuba who arrived with her mother in Chicago during a grey, snowy day in the 1970âs. She calls Chicago home and loves its parks and magnificent museums, the âLâ (elevated train), and the amazing cultural workers committed to social and environmental justice.         Jocelyn Munguia Chavez, BA, Program Coordinator         Jocelyn Munguia Chavez, Program Coordinator, they/them/theirs           They / Them / Theirs  jmungu2@uic.edu   Jocelyn MunguÃ­a ChÃ¡vez has been part of the LCC team since 2013. As a student educator, they led mural tours with the LCCâs Awakening of the Americas indoor mural. Throughout the years, they were also responsible for overseeing the gallery space requests as well as digital marketing for public programs. Their organizational skills, commitment and love for photography and social & environmental justice were a perfect match for the center. The love for science and helping others led them to pursue a B.A. in Applied Psychology at UIC in 2017. MunguÃ­a is now assisting with the development of public programs, expanding the LCC’s ARTivism series, leading bilingual tours and dialogues, and overseeing LCC interns and graphic designer.  During their undergraduate efforts, Jocelyn was one of the co-founders ofÂ Fearless Undocumented Alliance (FUA) , a student organization created as a support and advocacy group by and for undocumented students on campus. MunguÃ­a’s interests on education and mental health complemented FUAâs initiatives and they advocated for educational equity in IL through legislation. After graduating, Jocelyn researched and archived the accomplishments of FUA and their collaboration with the LCC for future generations. Check them out HERE .              Alonzo ZamarrÃ³n, BD, Graphic Designer         Alonzo ZamarrÃ³n, BD, Graphic Designer, he/him/his      He / Him / His  azamar4@uic.edu  Alonzo ZamarrÃ³n started as a Graphic Designer for the UIC Latino Cultural Center from Spring 2014 to Spring 2017, while pursuing a BFA in Graphic Design from UIC, and he continues to contribute his artistic eye to LCC promotional materials and more. Born and raised in Rochelle, IL and transplanted to Chicago, Alonzo became involved with many social justice movements by designing and printing their promotional material. After graduating, Alonzo was hired full-time in a roll that currently supports several UIC diversity units including the Latino Cultural Center, Office of Diversity, and the Womenâs Leadership and Resource Center.  During his spare time and on weekends, Alonzo plays the trumpet, saxophone, and guitar, as a member of Banda San Guillermo, Fuerte Arranke, and UICâs Mariachi Fuego. His musical performances have taken him to many cities across Illinois and the midwest which has exposed him to the many different ways the Latinx communities come together to celebrate.        Nadia Sol Ireri Unzueta Carrasco, BA, Heritage Garden Educator         Nadia Sol Ireri Unzueta Carrasco      They/Them/Theirs + Ellx/Ella  nunzue2@uic.edu  Ireri Unzueta Carrasco was born in Mexico DF and has lived and grown up in La Villita since the age of seven. Despite having lived in the US for 12 years, Ireri did not really start to feel at home until 2006, after joining a group of artisans and musicians who organized free art and music classes for the kids in Little Village. The group called itself Arte y Realidad, and the classes took place in a church garage, behind a cafe, and in public parks in Little Village, working with kids as young as two and as old as who ever showed up. It was a space that encouraged people to try to learn new skills, and held the central idea that everyone has something to teach and learn from one another. Ireri continues to hold this view as central to their work with young people, with immigrant communities, and with plants and ecosystems.  Ireri started out at UIC in 2005 through the College of Architecture, Design and the Arts, joining the Industrial Design program. Even though Ireri did not graduate with that degree, the Industrial Design program left them with an appreciation of how different peoples have practiced and still practice the cultivation of a relationship to the ecosystems around us of reciprocity, generosity, and community building, rather than the mainstream relationship of extraction, expendability, and individualism. And it was in the Gender and Womenâs Studies Department that Ireri was able to delve deep into discussions of identity, class, gender, citizenship or lack of, migration, through a historical and cultural lense that helped them make sense of the injustices they saw in their daily life. These lenses continue to shape how Ireri analyses and sees the world. Ireri graduated from UIC with a Bachelor of Arts in Gender and Womenâs Studies in 2009.  In 2009, tired of the frustrations and obstacles placed by a lack of immigration status, Ireri joined the Immigrant Youth Justice League, a group composed of young undocumented people working to diversify the narratives about being undocumented and creating spaces and resources for undocumented young people to navigate different aspects of life. Now, Ireri still collaborates with groups that uplift the organizing of undocumented immigrant communities, particularly working with Organized Communities Against Deportations (OCAD), and collaborating with Chicago Community and Workers Rights (CCWR). Ireri is also a proud worker owner of the workersâ cooperative Catatumbo Cooperative Farm in Chicago.        Lauren De Jesus, MA, Civic Engagement Educator         lauren      She / Her / Hers  ldejes3@uic.edu  Lauren De Jesus started as a Graduate Assistant from Fall 2017 to Spring 2019. She grew up volunteering in her community on the Northwest side and visiting Chicago’s museums. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2016 and recently completed her Masterâs in Museum and Exhibition Studies at UIC. Throughout these experiences, she developed a passion for cultures, museum work, and social justice.

As an LCC student educator, Luis hopes to engage more people in conversations concerning the connections between culture and the environment.
