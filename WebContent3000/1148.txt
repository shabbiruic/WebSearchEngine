The mural represented important events in the history of Latin America prior and after 1492 and the subsequent history of Latinos in the United States. In late 1993, the LCC space was reconstructed and the office was moved to the lower floor. Consequently, most of the mural was destroyed and only one scene was preserved on the stairs that lead to the office. In 1995-1996, a new mural was commissioned to Mexican muralist Hector Duarte for the LCC Gallery on the main floor. This mural calledÂ El Despertar de las Americas Â (The Awakening of the Americas) is featured on all four walls of the LCC Gallery and part of the lobby.
