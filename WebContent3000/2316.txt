The program is highly competitive, attracting students from all over the world, and offers opportunities for individualized work to meet the individual needs of each prospective student. The program provides intensive coursework and strong emphasis is placed on combining fundamentals of statistics and research design with theoretical frameworks from decision and information sciences, economics, psychology, epidemiology, communication, public health, and education.       Research Emphasis      A primary goal of the program is to produce graduates who can independently conduct high-quality research that is both significant and innovative, with implications for health and health care. Students benefit from the strong research programs of the Department, which are facilitated by local, national, and international partnerships with government agencies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, professional associations, and with other researchers. Areas of emphasis (and specialization for students) include pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research, pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety, pharmacy systems and policy, and pharmaceutical education research.       Work along side top faculty      Students in the program will work with faculty who are national and international leaders in their areas of expertise. The faculty members of the Department have leadership positions in academic and professional associations, are editors of major medical and pharmacy journals, and serve on boards of pharmacy and healthcare-related companies and foundations. Along with the full-time members, adjunct and affiliate faculty members from government, industry, and pharmacy practice, provide complementary expertise and contribute to the mission of the department.
