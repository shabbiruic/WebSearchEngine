The initiative supports undergraduate students who want to teach and serve as role models in urban elementary schools to positively impact the lives of children.  Originally founded at Clemson University, Call Me MISTER is now a nationally recognized initiative with more than 30 partner schools.  Call Me MISTER requires a deep commitment to becoming an elementary school teacher. The support from the College of Education is meant to encourage and develop the passion of teaching, and includes:  â¢ Tuition support  â¢ Book support  â¢ Academic support  â¢ Program mentors  â¢ Summer leadership institutes  â¢ Professional development opportunities  â¢ Assistance with job placement  The first Call Me MISTER cohort began at the UIC College of Education in Fall 2018.
