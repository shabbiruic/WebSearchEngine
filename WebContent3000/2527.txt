Â About 80 percent of UIC students receive some type of financial assistance for their education and there are a variety of opportunities to Â lower tuition costs. Â Some of those include Federal aid and loans,Â but there are also opportunities for scholarship awards, student employment, and grants. Â Graduate students can further reduce tuition by way of fellowships, research assistantships, and grants in and out of the university.
