Feminist Page-turners       Feminist Page-turners   Each semester, WLRC selects written works that expand our imaginations around feminisms and hosts discussions about their prominent themes.     Onwards: Feminisms in Conversation       Onwards: Feminisms in Conversation   This conversation series aims to bring people together to talk about difficult issues that overlap with, but are not limited to, feminisms. Onwards provides an opportunity for people to speak frankly about the significance of feminisms in our past, present, and future.  The series was inspired by the critiques and the sense of urgency that emerged in the days following the Womenâs March in January 2017: the need for spaces to learn, read, and talk together about the feminist histories we have inherited and the futures that we imagine and want to build together.
