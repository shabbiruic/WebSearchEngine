We collect, analyzeÂ and mine dialogues for instructional / collaboration strategies that are cognitively plausible and correlate withÂ learning. Several software systems have resulted from this work. In our first project, DIAG-NLP ( Di EugenioÂ et al., 2005; Di Eugenio et al., 2008), we showed that more concise and abstract feedback would lead to moreÂ learning in diagnosing simulated malfunctions of a mechanical system. In the last few years, we have focusedÂ on instruction in introductory Computer Science classes. We investigated two different approaches: iList, anÂ Intelligent Tutoring System ( Fossati et al., 2008; Â Fossati et al., 2009a; Fossati et al., 2009b), and KSC-PaL, aÂ system with which a student can collaborate as if with a real peer ( Kersey et al., 2009; Â Kersey et al., 2010 ).Â Both systems have been found to be conducive to learning. In particular, iList has been evaluated with more thanÂ 200 students, and downloaded by about 1500 additional users (iList is publicly available and downloadable fromÂ http://www.digitaltutor.net/ ). Our current funding from the Qatar Research Foundation (NPRPÂ award 5-939-1-155) seeks to expand iList into ChiQat-Tutor. This research covers the gamut from investigatingÂ the best pedagogical strategies to teach recursion to sophisticated data mining models of the log data from iListÂ (Di Eugenio et al., 2013b).
