We aim to increase and diversify participation in research, scholarship, and creative endeavors by forging partnerships on and off campus and leading initiatives such as those listed below.  We help students toâ¦       Make a connection:   The Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) is a university-wide initiative dedicated to fostering scholarly engagement and intellectual growth. Its mission is to make research an integral part of the undergraduate academic experience at UIC by creating mutually beneficial research relationships between students and faculty researchers. Its backbone is an interactive database that students can use to search for faculty with undergraduate research positions and where faculty and other campus researchers can list opportunities and identify themselves as committed to supervising and mentoring undergraduate researchers.  Summer College Event: The Research University and You The Office of Undergraduate Research offers a one-day event in July to help incoming first-year students and transfers âmake the connectionâ at UIC. The program includes faculty guest speakers, a research site visit, resource tutorials, and network-building experiences that activate studentsâ creative and academic curiosity and connect them earlier and in stronger ways to UIC as a community of learning and discovery.  Program details for summer 2020 will be announced shortly.       Fund their work:   The Chancellorâs Undergraduate Research Award Â allows students who qualify for and have accepted Federal Work Study as part of their current yearâs financial aid package to work as research assistants for hourly pay–at no cost to faculty or departments. Faculty apply online on behalf of the student(s) they have recruited. Students are hired by the faculty memberâs department just as any other Federal Work Study employee would be, and reimbursed through the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Affairs and Academic Programs at the end of the semester. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis until FWS enrollment ends for the campus as a whole.  We also provide information about numerous funded research opportunities run out of individual UIC labs and research groups, departments, and colleges as well as sources of support for students conducting, presenting, and publishing research while studying abroad, during the summer, and between undergraduate and graduate or professional school. Follow the O.U.R. on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for upcoming deadlines.       Share their results:   Impact and Research Day Â  The O.U.R. and the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Affairs and Academic Programs partner with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Center for Student Involvement, the Honors College, Career Services, the University Library and the Graduate College to plan and host the UIC Student Research Forum and Impact day. Each spring UIC students from every discipline present their research, scholarship and high-impact engagements, accompanied by a poster or other visual display that captures the spirit of the research work and/or highlights key features of the project. Students from all disciplines (Arts, Business, Computer Science, Engineering, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, among others) speak one-on-one to Forum attendees and judges during a high-energy 3-hour session, followed by a keynote address and awards ceremony. For more information about submitting and abstract or serving as a faculty or alumni judge, see the Impact and Research Day page.  University of Illinois Undergraduate Research Day â Posters Under the Dome” Posters Under the Dome is a collaboration between the University of Illinois at Chicago, Urbana-Champaign, and Springfield, spotlighting the discoveries and accomplishments of undergraduates who are engaged in research. It provides a venue for students to present their work in poster format at the Illinois State Capitol to Illinois representatives and others on a day dedicated specifically to undergraduate research.Â The event also helps members of the Illinois legislature better understand the importance of involving undergraduates in research, scholarly, and creative work.  Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Journal Â  In collaboration with theÂ UIC Honors College , the University Library, and the Graduate College, the O.U.R. publishes an inter-disciplinary open access research journal for undergraduate work. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty serve as section editors and peer reviewers and undergraduate students learn hands-on about processes of conducting research, undergoing formal peer review, editing, revising, doing layout, copy-editing, and engaging in journal publicity.
