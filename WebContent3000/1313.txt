Transcripts of all undergraduate and any graduate work must be submitted. In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, applicants must meet the program requirements as listed below.   To apply directly to the joint program, students must apply to each of the individual degree programs separately, noting that they are applying to the joint program. To be admitted to the joint program, a student must meet the admission requirements for both individual degree programs.  To transfer into the joint program from the MS in Computer Science, students who enter the two-year MS program and later decide to transfer into the joint program may do so before entering their second year of study if they meet the admission requirements of the MFA program. Similarly to transfer into the joint program from the MFA, students who enter the two-year MFA program and later decide to transfer into the joint program may do so before entering their second year of study if they meet the requirements of the MS program. In both cases, the student will be required to petition their home department graduate committee and commit to completing the requirements of both programs within three years.  Registration Advising Students in the program will be advised on general logistics and requirements of the MS and MFA programs by both the graduate academic advisor in the Department of Computer Science and the director of graduate studies in the School of Art & Art History. Additionally, faculty advisors (appointed from both Computer Science and Art) will jointly advise students on understanding course sequence requirements and on elective options.  Students who leave after completing the necessary hours and project requirements for only one of the degrees, either the MS or MFA, may receive that degree provided that they are in good academic standing and successfully petition the Graduate Committees of both departments.  Deadlines The application deadline for this program is earlier than the Graduate College deadline; for information on current deadlines, please see: http://arch.uic.edu/graduate-admissions .
