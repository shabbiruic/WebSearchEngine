SPH Strategic Planning      On behalf of the UIC School of Public Health (UIC SPH), I’d like to welcome you to our strategic planning site.  We are in the process of revising our 2013-2018 strategic plan to set course through the year 2023.Â  Strategic planning is important for setting priorities for our School, aligning everyone with the same future direction, simplifying decision making, and guiding our fundraising efforts.  The UIC SPHÂ Executive Committee has charged our standing committees with revising our community goals and measurable objectives to incorporate priority areas we identified during a school-wide retreat in August 2017:   Community Engaged Research  Diversity  Global Health  Intellectual Space  Student Success     From the beginning, our strategic planning process was designed to be inclusive of UIC SPH students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community and public health partners.Â  Once complete, our strategic plan will be presented to our faculty for approval in September 2018, and will be consistent with our mission, which is as follows: Â  âThe UIC School of Public Health is dedicated to excellence in protecting and improving the health and well-Â­being of the people of the metropolitan Chicago area, the State of Illinois, and the nation, and of others throughout the worldâ  I would like to thank the UIC SPH faculty, staff, students, alumni, and partners for their engagement in the planning process thus far.Â  I am excited to see what goals and objectives our workgroups propose, and encourage everyone to harness this momentum to propel UIC SPH forward in the months ahead.
