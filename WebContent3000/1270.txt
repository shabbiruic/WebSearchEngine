Major research areas concern the isolation, structure elucidation, and biological assessment of natural products; plant and microbial constituents from terrestrial and marine sources, having biological activity; the use and conservation of plants employed in traditional medicine; the fundamental mechanisms of biological activity of potential drugs and their targets both in vitro and in vivo; structure and function of cellular enzymes, microbial genomics; and drug discovery. Pharmacognosy participates in a joint PharmD/PhD program; see the Joint PharmD/PhD section of the catalog for more information. In parallel to but separately from the pharmacognosy graduate program, the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences also offers work leading to graduate degrees in Medicinal Chemistry; consult the Medicinal Chemistry section of the catalog for more information. Applicants should apply to their specific program of choice within the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and are encouraged to contact the program for clarification.
