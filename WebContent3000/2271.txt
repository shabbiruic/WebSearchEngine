The ERM online certificate provides opportunities for several populations: private and public sector workers in education and other social science fields who want to upgrade their research skills, graduate students from education and other fields who want training in research methods, and those individuals desiring to pursue a shorter and focused course of study in educational research methods with an option to apply for the full MEd in MESA online program.

Sign up for our email list       About the Certificate    The ERM online certificate draws courses from the MEd MESA Online program. Here are some basic definitions of these terms.   Measurement involves the assignment of numbers to objects such that the numbers represent degrees or quantities of unobservable constructs such as attitudes, achievement, self-efficacy, self-esteem, etc.  Evaluation involves the systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs to make judgments about program quality, improve program effectiveness and/or inform decisions about future program development.  Statistics aims at learning the process that generated the data, including learning how a given variable is affected by other variables, and learning about the true (population) distribution of the data.  Assessment involves the processes of collecting, synthesizing, analyzing and interpreting quantitative and qualitative information to aid in decision-making.     For more information, visit the ERM page on the UIC Extended Campus website, or contact the MESA Online Admissions Team at onlineinfo@uic.edu Â or at 866-772-2268, Option 1.
