Entre Prisesâ is the worldâs premier climbing wall manufacturer and Free Form is the most advanced product in climbing wall technology. Free Form accurately simulates the look, feel, and detail of real rock! Our wall is 43 feet tall, 7 top ropes across, and has a stunning variety of built-in features such as: cracks, flakes, pockets, arÃªtes, a dihedral, as well as endless intricate features.  Rock-climbing is a multi-dimensional sport that requires strength and flexibility, as well as a high level of endurance and skill. It also offers a balance between physical exercise and mental discipline. Climbers will quickly begin to develop hand, arm, back, and core strength as a result of the movements the climber needs to scale the wall. With practice, climbers will see improvement in agility, their ability to increase strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility in hips and hamstrings.  In addition, our friendly staff would love to introduce you to this popular and fast growing sport. We are constantly changing our routes to challenge every type of climber from beginner to advanced skill levels. Each route varies in length and style so climbs never get tedious.       accordion     Hours         Hours   Academic Session  Sunday 12:00 pm – 5:00 pm  Monday 4:00 pm – 9:00 pm  Tuesday 11:00 am – 1:00 pmÂ  Â  Â  Â 4:00 pm-9:00 pm  Wednesday 11:00 am – 1:00 pmÂ  Â  Â  Â 4:00 pm-9:00 pm  Thursday 11:00 am – 1:00 pmÂ  Â  Â  Â 4:00 pm-9:00 pm  Friday 4:00 pm – 8:00 pm  Saturday 11:00 am â 3:0 0pm  Academic Breaks & Summer Hours  Sunday 12:00 pm – 5:00 pm  Monday Closed  Tuesday 3:00pm – 7:00pm  Wednesday 3:00 pm – 7:00 pm  Thursday 3:00 pm – 7:00 pm  Friday Closed  Saturday 11:00 am â 3:00 pm        Rentals & Reservations         Rentals & Reservations   The climbing wall can be rented for birthday parties, student organization meetings,Â  and private events.
