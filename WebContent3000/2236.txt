Six key themes guide the program:   The urban context is key and underscores an emphasis on specific opportunities andÂ complex challenges  Building and maintaining equity and authentic diversity in higher education is essential  Everyone in the organization is a leader, change agent and advocate who contributes to the continued improvement and advancement of the institution  Principled leadership and ethical behavior are the foundation for sound professional practice  Teamwork and collaboration are crucial for continuous organizational improvement and advancement  Best practice in higher education requires evidence-based and data-informed decision-making   Program themes and coursework build on current strengths of the College of Education, particularly within the Educational Policy Studies (EDPS) department. The program's two areas of emphasis draw direct benefit from the College's award-winning Urban Education Leadership program, and its well-established Measurement, Evaluation, Statistics, and Assessment (MESA) program.       Faculty leadership and support   The Educational Policy Studies departmentâs Education Organization and Leadership and Social Foundations faculty, and the collegeâs MESA faculty have a long history of working with students interested in higher education topics, problems, and research. In 2018-2019, 92% of EDPS graduate level courses were taught by full time faculty or adjunct faculty with doctoral degrees and professional practice expertise. The MEd in Urban Higher Education program has a very similar teaching profile.       Questions about the program? Contact:      Celina
