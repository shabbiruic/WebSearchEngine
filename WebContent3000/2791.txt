Its mission is to make research an integral part of the undergraduate academic experience at UIC by creating mutually beneficial research relationships between students and faculty researchers. Its backbone is an interactive database that students can use to search for faculty with undergraduate research positions and where faculty and other campus researchers can list opportunities and identify themselves as committed to supervising and mentoring undergraduate researchers.  Summer College Event: The Research University and You The Office of Undergraduate Research offers a one-day event in July to help incoming first-year students and transfers âmake the connectionâ at UIC. The program includes faculty guest speakers, a research site visit, resource tutorials, and network-building experiences that activate studentsâ creative and academic curiosity and connect them earlier and in stronger ways to UIC as a community of learning and discovery.  Program details for summer 2020 will be announced shortly .       Join a program:   There are many great opportunities for students all around the country and the world. Look through the opportunities menu on the left hand side.  Follow the links provided and read everything carefully, since each program has its own requirements and expectations. The OUR strongly recommends that you work with your faculty mentors, support center mentors, academic advisors, the director of undergraduate studies in your major, the UIC Writing Center, or the O.U.R. for assistance as you make your plans and develop your statements of purpose.Â  Note: (These opportunities are provided for informational purposes and should not be understood as a complete list of opportunities nor as an endorsement.
