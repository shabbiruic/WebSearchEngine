Visit the  Delta Omega website       Delta Omega Honory Society Scholarship Application Information     Scholarship Application Information         Scholarship Application Information   Dear SPH Graduating and Recently Graduated Students:  Would you be interested in becoming a member of theÂ Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health ?Â  If you graduated in Summer or Fall 2019 or have applied to graduate in Spring 2020, now is the time for you to apply for Delta Omega.  Delta Omega members are inducted by local chapters through a highly-selective process that assesses their outstanding performance and devotion to the field. To maintain the credibility of this prestigious society, chapters are limited in the number of members they may induct each year.Â  Each year our Lambda Chapter at UIC selects new student, faculty and alumni members, according to the national guideline for yearly inductions.  To be considered for this honor, you must be ranked in the upper 25% of their graduating class (usually this translates to a GPA of over 3.90 on a 4 point scale at UIC SPH),Â andÂ you should demonstrate public health leadership qualities in addition to academic excellence. Students who graduated in Summer 2019 or Fall 2019, or expect to graduate in Spring 2020 are now being considered. Selection is very competitive, and only 10% of the graduating class meeting the top 25% GPA criteria can be selected.  Delta Omega members have a number of benefits available to them. At the national level, Delta Omega offers all chapters and members with leadership development and publication opportunities, networking opportunities, and discounted resources. For more details, please see:Â https://deltaomega.org/member-benefits/  If you want to be considered for this honor, please apply via the UIC SNAP application system at:Â https://uic.academicworks.com/opportunities/8253    The deadline to be considered is  March 6, 2020. Student inductees will be noted in the Spring 2020 SPH Commencement Program.    Best Wishes,  John    John T.
