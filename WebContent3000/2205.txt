Yes, applications are accepted for admittance in each semesterâFall, Spring, Summer.  Do I have to take the GRE?  No.  How long is the program?  The program is flexible, allowing students to progress at their own rate, depending on whether you attend full time or part time. Most part-time students complete this degree program over a 2-year (2 courses/semester) to 3-year (1-2 courses/semester) period.  Can I still work and complete this program?  Yes, the majority of MEd LLL students still maintain part-time or even full-time employment while pursuing the program.  Do I need a degree in education or a teaching license to be admitted into this program?  No, but you cannot obtain either the Reading Endorsement (Strand A) or the Reading Specialist certificate (Strand B) without an Illinois Professional Educator License (PEL). This program does not lead to licensure.  Can I transfer other coursework I've completed elsewhere into this program?   Up to 12 hours of graduate UIC credit can be transferred into this program, with adviser approval.  Up to 9 hours of non-UIC graduate level credit can be transferred into this program, with adviser approval.   Can I defer enrollment?  Yes, with the program coordinator's approval enrollment can be deferred for up to one year.  Are classes taught on Saturday?  No, classes are offered Monday through Thursday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.  Is there financial assistance available?  Yes. For scholarship information, please check with the department for more information. If you are a full-time student, you may want to explore the possibility of a position as a Research Assistant (RA). RAs work anywhere from 10 to 26 hours per week on a research project that education faculty are conducting. This pays a stipend for hours worked and, depending on the position, may also provide tuition and fee remission.
