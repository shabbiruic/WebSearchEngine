Graduation is the official awarding of degrees earned, while Commencement is the event which celebrates the completion of degree programs.  The university-wide graduation date for Spring 2020 at UIC is May 10. However, each college hosts its own commencement ceremony event in the days leading up to the graduation. For Spring 2020, UIC Education students officially receive their degrees on May 10, but they celebrate on May 7 at the College of Education’s commencement ceremony.
