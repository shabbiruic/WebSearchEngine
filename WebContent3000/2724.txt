We usually post for academic year positions, but occasionally do offer semester long appointments.       Internship   The Arab American Cultural Center (ArabAmCC)âs internship program aims to contribute to the academic and professional growth of interns by providing training and mentorship in office management, events planning, professional engagement, cultural competency (including gaining greater knowledge about Arab and Muslim and Arab and Muslim American communities), and public speaking. Interns will receive a $500 stipend per semester. Interns can also receive academic credit. Internships in good standing can lead to future employment opportunity with the ArabAmCC in future semesters.
