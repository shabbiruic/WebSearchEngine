Â The CUPPA Dean’s Council is comprised of thought leaders in fields which shape and guide contemporary issues of urban and metropolitan regions who provide insight on current and emerging issues in their respective fields, and on strategic thinking that will help CUPPA shape future directions for the College.  The sharing of their individual areas of expertise broadens and deepens the ongoing conversation in which CUPPA engages about transforming cities and metropolitan regions, improving public and non-profit management, as well as enhancing the urban condition more generally.Â  One of CUPPAâs many assets is its multiple partnerships and collaborations with nonprofits, foundations, corporations, and other Universities.Â Â  The Dean’s Council plays a significant role in strengthening and expanding these relationships by identifying new partners, enabling alliances, and enhancing the visibility and recognition of the College.  CUPPA Dean’s Council members advance the work of the College by increasing the visibility and impact of CUPPAâs research and scholarship with stakeholder partners in the corporate and civic communities and by serving as ambassadors through their professional interactions and contacts.Â  Members of the Dean’s Council, in knowing and telling CUPPAâs story, in particular its alumniâs significant impact on the landscape and leadership of Chicago, serve an essential role in promoting the mission and vision of the College.
