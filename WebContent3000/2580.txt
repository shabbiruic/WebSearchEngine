Â Students learn how to plan for the physical design of cities using spatial thinking that combines analyses of places, meaningful engagement with diverse communities and design knowledge across scale. Â Hands-on field-based studio learning provides immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice in complex urban places across Chicago.      The Master of City Design will meet demand from domestic and international students with bachelor degrees in architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and related disciplines. The program will prepare students for entry-level city/urban design employment or enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design.Â MCD trains students to work in urban settings worldwide.
