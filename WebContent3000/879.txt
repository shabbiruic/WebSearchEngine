Drive Discovery   The deepest processes of our own minds. What the cities and structures of tomorrow might look like. How to consider what âhealthyâ means for populations that span the Earth. Weâre igniting change to chase discoveries that change lives. All 7.4 billion of them.       "I am now a better person"           With your help in this campaign we will drive life-changing discoveries by:    Delivering real solutions to the worldâs most crucial challenges by investing in areas of research excellence.  Building programs and gaining partners around the world to advance global health.  Elevating our visibility as a national and global leader in promoting social equity through healthcare, education, and research.
