The specific material depends on what degree you would like to earn, whether you sing and, if you play, what instrument you play. If you have a private lesson teacher or music teacher in school, they may be able to help you select and prepare your materials.  On the Day of Your Audition  On the date of your audition, we will meet you at the lower level of UIC's School of Theatre & Music at 1044 W Harrison. Our building is very easily accessible via the CTA Blue Line; exit on the UICÂ­Halsted stop and exit towards Morgan (not Halsted). If you prefer, paid parking is available in the lot just west of our building. You may arrive up to an hour before your assigned time, and plan to be on campus for at least 1.5 hours after your time begins. Warmup space will be available at least 15 minutes before your time. If you would like to brush up your skills, musictheory.net offers free theory lessons online.Â   Here are two parts of your day at UIC:  Audition . This is when you will play or sing for 2-3 members of the music faculty. We will also talk with you about your background and interests in music (20 minutes).  Aural Musicianship Checkup & Music Notation Diagnostic Test . The information we gain by your doing this does not determine whether you are admitted or not. It just allows us to plan for which music skills classes would be the best ones for you in the event that you are a student in the fall.Â  These diagnostic tests tell use two things about your background: First, how well you can play somethingâin this case just a 3-4 note patternâby ear, without music notation. We also want to find out how much you know about music notation and theory. The exams should take about 30 minutes.   Music Ensemble Auditions  The information above is only for those individuals interested in enrolling in a music degree program.Â If you are interested in any of our music ensembles,Â information can be found on the Ensemble Auditions Page .Â                                    Search form   Search            Enter your email address to subscribe to our mailing list:         Privacy policy        College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts
