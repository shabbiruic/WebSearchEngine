It is advisable to write your UIN on every page of documentation you submit and also to print legibly within the appropriate sections of a form.Â  This ensures that documents can be promptly read and processed.  Please note, due to the COVID-19 crisis, financial aid is only able to accept uploaded documentation (seeÂ PDF Upload Guide Â for assistance)Â at this time.
