Start early and prepare for success  For many awards, you may need to position yourself by gaining key co-curricular experiences, like research and internships, over many semesters, including the summers. Starting in your first year is ideal. OEF and your advisor can help you develop these experiences by connecting you with the best people and resources. Finally, fellowship applications are not something that you can hammer out in a weekend or even a week. You should start working with your award advisor well in advance of the deadline and then work continuously on drafts that evolve toward a polished product.  Gain readinessÂ  Not only does civic engagement and community involvement provide real-world experience and learning but volunteering and leadership activities also strengthen your application and position as a candidate. UIC offers opportunities to get engaged through the Student Leadership and Civic Engagement site as well as through individual schools and colleges.
