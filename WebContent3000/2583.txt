Student Achievement  Goals of the MUPP program are to:   Prepare MUPP students for professional employment in urban planning related occupations  Support and promote collaborative learning among faculty and students with colleagues,Â citizens and organizations in civic domains ranging from the local to the global scale  Strive to offer practical professional advice through an array of integrated teaching, research and service activities for a diverse clientele coping with complex urban problems.   An outcome measure associated with these goals is: Graduates will be able to compose professional advice combining writing, speaking, enumerating, visualizing and computing skills to offer practically relevant and professionally competent products. Achievement of this outcome is measured in UPP 506: Plan-Making Studio, a required course that is a centerpiece of the MUPP curriculum, taken in the spring of the first year. A common problem is developed by faculty; it addresses current issues and challenges facing a community in the Chicago area. Problems have ranged from the neighborhood to the sub-regional level. Achievement is measured by grades received in UPP 506, with a benchmark of 85% of students meeting or exceeding expectations. A grade of âAâ indicated exceeding the benchmark; âBâ meeting expectations; âCâ partially meeting expectations, and âDâ or âFâ failing to meet expectations.  In Spring 2019, the number of students assessed was 53; 46 exceeded expectations, and 6 met expectations. No students partially met or failed to meet expectations.    2019-2020 Tuition and Fees  In State Residents, per full-time academic year $ 21,314  Out of State Residents, per full-time academic year $ 33,554    Student Retention Rate  Percent  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2018 and continued into fall 2019 95%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2017 and continued into fall 2018 85%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2016 and continued into fall 2017 92%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2015 and continued into fall 2016 81%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2014 and continued into fall 2015 92%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2013 and continued into fall 2014 96%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2012 and continued into fall 2013 94%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2011 and continued into fall 2012 86%  Percentage of students whoÂ began studies in fall 2010 and continued into fall 2011 89%    Student Graduation Rate  Percent  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2015 97%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2014 82%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2013 80%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2012 77%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2011 77%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2010 100%  Percentage of students graduating within 4 years, entering class of 2009 81%    Number of Degrees Awarded  Number of degrees awarded for the 2018 -
