We are here to answer questions and provide support if you or a loved one is in a situation like this. If you are looking for shelter, food, or safety planning, please reach out to CAN to learn the options available on and off campus. We also encourage you to check in with friends and family who may be vulnerable and share our contact information with them.  If you are concerned that someone may be monitoring your phone or computer, please review the Technology Safety Toolkit from the National Network to End Domestic Violence.

Interdependent UIC: Accessibility Considerations for Remote Access   Margaret Fink, Director of UIC’s Disability Cultural Center, has created a shared, living Google doc about COVID-19.Â  It started as a document about accessibility for remote teaching, but its focus has expanded to be a social-justice-focused resource around COVID-19. We hope you find it useful.
