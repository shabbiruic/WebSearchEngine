The General Education Program provides students with a breadth of exposure to the academic disciplines and serves as the foundation for the knowledge, skills, and competencies essential to becoming well-educated college graduates and citizens.  The program ensures a certain level of intellectual breadth, while at the same time allowing students the opportunity to select courses or clusters of courses around areas of their own interests. Specifically, the program:   provides intellectual guidance by identifying six broad areas of knowledge that correspond to the kinds of experiences that a liberally educated person should have.  makes clear to students what they are taking and why.  is an open system that does not bind departments into one category. This model thus allows for the development of interdepartmental courses over time. It also allows students to gain interdisciplinary perspectives, which was one of the hoped for outcomes of revising General Education.  gives individual colleges some freedom to adjust the General Education requirements to suit their own needs. Although there is a campus wide minimum of one course from each General Education category, colleges may add additional course requirements.   The General Education Program at UIC  The General Education Program at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. It also helps prepare students for the world beyond the college experience, a world in which one needs to be able to:   think independently.  understand and critically evaluate information.  analyze and evaluate arguments.  develop and present cogent written and oral arguments.  explore oneâs own culture and history as well as those of others.  understand, interpret, and evaluate the arts.  think critically about how individuals influence and are influenced by political, economic, cultural, and family institutions.   The General Education Program at UIC (sometimes referred to as Gen Ed or GE) has two main components: a grouping of core courses that are clustered around six themes and sets of required proficiencies. The specific requirements vary from college to college. All colleges, however, require a minimum of 24 semester hours of credit with at least one course in each of the six categories of General Education and proficiency in writing (as demonstrated by successful completion of ENGLÂ 160 and ENGLÂ 161 or by certain scores on placement or other tests). Note: Students may count up to two courses in their major toward their General Education requirements. If students have a double major, then two courses from each of the majors may be applied toward General Education.  General Education Core  The General Education Core includes the following six categories. This section of the catalog provides a description and list of courses for each category.   Analyzing the Natural World  Understanding the Individual and Society  Understanding the Past  Understanding the Creative Arts  Exploring World Cultures  Understanding U.S. Society   General Education Proficiencies  The University Writing requirement is common across all colleges. Individual colleges may have additional General Education requirements and proficiencies. Students should consult their college and department sections of the catalog for information about fulfilling the General Education requirements as a required part of their degree program.  University Writing Requirement  Students must demonstrate proficiency in written English by earning passing grades in ENGLÂ 160 and ENGLÂ 161 , or by achieving proficiency (see section on Demonstrating Writing Proficiency for a Waiver of ENGLÂ 160 Â or ENGLÂ 161 ) in one or both of these courses certified in writing by the Department of English. The Department of English reserves the right to require a student to take a preparatory course as a prerequisite for ENGLÂ 160 if the studentâs score on the Writing Placement Test reveals the need for such a course. Whenever questions arise with regard to the fulfillment of the University Writing requirement through transfer courses, a writing portfolio, or standard examinations, the Department of English will determine whether to grant the student an exemption from the requirement.  Students should consult their college section of the catalog for more information on fulfilling the University Writing requirement as part of their degree program.  General Education Core  Analyzing the Natural World  A central principle of a knowledge-based society is that, where possible, experimental tests should be designed to critically evaluate the accuracy of an idea or physical law. It is crucial that students understand both how accurate experimental results are obtained and how uncertainties in these results affect scientific conclusions. Courses in this category provide an understanding of scientific method and the factual knowledge necessary to develop hypotheses, to test them, and to distinguish those conclusions resting on unsupported assertion from those verified by sound scientific reasoning. Theories also play an important role in the way we see the world around us. In the natural sciences, theories are developed to explain experimental observation, form the basis for the design of further experiments, and provide the foundation for advances in technology. Mathematics provides appropriate tools (such as calculus) necessary to formulate the scientific theories.  Courses in this category should introduce students to scientific and mathematical concepts and methods. They should be designed to facilitate the studentsâ ability to do one or more of the following:   Understand and critically evaluate information and concepts in the natural and mathematicalÂ sciences.  Use and understand scientific method to analyze ideas and obtain knowledge.  Appreciate the value of and difference between scientific laws, theories, hypotheses, and speculation.  Use scientific and mathematical reasoning to make relevant distinctions among ideas.  Think critically about contemporary issues in science and technology.  Logically and clearly communicate experimental results and observations to others.  Analyze quantitative information and draw conclusions from these analyses.

Understanding the Individual and Society  The primary goal of the Individual and Society requirement is to enhance understanding of the complex activities of individuals and their relations with each other and with groups, institutions, governments, media, and society. Courses within this category seek to:   enhance knowledge and appreciation of the diversity of individuals, societies, and cultures  advance the understanding of human relationships within different contexts and  explore the gathering and assessing of knowledge within any social setting or activity.   Courses present theories about the human activities and ideas and demonstrate how scholars use qualitative, quantitative, and humanistic methods to evaluate those theories. They may also explore the ways that knowledge is formed about the self and the world in historical, literary, philosophical, and scientific realms.  Courses in this category should introduce students either to the complexities of the individual or the relationship of the individual to social structures. They should be designed to facilitate the studentsâ ability to do one or more of the following:   Recognize, describe, and explain social institutions, structures, and processes and the complexities of a global culture and diverse society.  Think critically about how individuals influence and are influenced by political, geographic, economic, cultural, and family institutions in their own and other cultures and explain how oneâs knowledge and beliefs may differ from others.  Explain the relationship between the individual and society as it influences  individualsâ cognition, ethics, social interactions, communication practices and affect; and  the quality of life of the individual, the family, and the community.    Examine how literature, history, ethical systems, scientific inquiry, or communicative practice shape our knowledge and perception of individuals and social structures.  Using the most appropriate principles, methods, and technologies, gather and analyze previous inquiry regarding the relationships between individuals and society, draw logical conclusions about such inquiry, and creatively or scientifically apply those conclusions to oneâs life and society.

The objects of study in these courses include the human past and its historical record; the emergence and transformation of nations, states, ideas, and civilizations; traditions and modes of human thought; the relationship between ideas and practices; and the implications of scientific discovery and technological innovation.  Courses in this category should have as their primary focus significant past events. They should be designed to facilitate the studentsâ ability to do one or more of the following:   Understand the implication and meaning of technological innovation and scientific discovery for the development of human society.  Critically analyze the cultural, economic, geographical, and political processes that influenced historical events.  Recognize, describe, and explain the nature of past historical events and their consequences for the present.  Examine the relationship between individuals and past events, their interactions, and the repercussions of these interactions.  Understand and explain the significance and influence of the past and its connection to current political, scientific, and cultural forces.

Courses in literature (e.g., fiction, poetry, drama), the arts (e.g., painting, sculpture, architecture, design, music, theatre and dance, film, photography, new media) and philosophy examine materials that explore and express the potential of the human imagination. Courses fulfilling this requirement acquaint students with issues involved in making, interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating written texts, musical works, visual and material culture, performing arts, and other media presentations in the context of the histories and cultures that have shaped and been shaped by their production. The aim is to develop the ability to read, experience, and view carefully, to think critically, to argue cogently and to communicate ideas effectively in written and oral form.  All cultures create stories, images, objects, built environments, dramas, music, etc. The study of such cultural products is an area with its own questions, techniques, and traditions. A student taking courses in this area can expect to study, in close detail, a number of significant works of literature, art, or other media. Courses in this category should facilitate a studentâs ability to address one or more of the following questions:   Basic issues of interpretation. How does a work mean anything? How does one determine meaning? How can a work have numerous meanings, often at the same time?  Questions of poetics. How do the traditions of genres and forms, materials and means of production, and philosophies and theories influence individual literary and artistic works and their interpretation?  Questions of value. How can such creative works be evaluated? How are critical vocabularies developed? How does a work come to be called a âclassicâ? How do new works and genres become accepted as art?  Questions of cultural and historical context. How do creative works relate to the societies in which they are produced and received? How do cultural roles of creative products, definitions of art, institutions, markets, and patronage affect the creation of works of architecture, art, music, literature, and other media?

Understanding U.S. Society  Exploring World Cultures  A global society demands that individuals gain an appreciation of cultures that are different from their own. Courses in this category explore how cultures function and how they may arise and change, whether through the internationalization of economies, social or political forces, changes in environment, or the development of new technologies. Further, these courses aim to provide students with the necessary tools to study and evaluate disparate social systems and cultural products.  Courses in this category should address significant aspects of any culture that is not part of the mainstream American culture. They should be designed to facilitate the studentsâ ability to do one or more of the following:   Analyze a culture, including its political, social, ethical, communicative, or economic systems.  Analyze how cultures are formed, transmitted, and changed.  Compare different cultures.  Explore the values or cultural products of non-U.S. cultures.  Analyze the influence of other cultures upon U.S. culture.

country that is often characterized by its diversity, including diversity of cultures, religions, classes, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and gender practices. The aim of this category is to study these diversities, explore the principles and experiences that unite us in the face of them, and perhaps most importantly, to examine critically the social, cultural, and political tensions that arise between that which unites and that which divides us. The goal is thus to understand our society and our political and economic systems, whether to gain knowledge of the past events that have shaped current ones, to gain the means to evaluate critically current policy and to shape future ones, or to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of our current communities.  Courses in this category should address some significant aspect of U.S. society as their central focus. They should be designed to facilitate the studentsâ ability to do one or more of the following:   Analyze aspects of U.S. society.  Analyze the communicative, political, social, economic, or cultural systems in the U.S.  Explore the diverse communitiesâracial, ethnic, class, gender, religious, and sexualâthat define cultural and political life in the United States.  Critically examine the tensions among various groups within U.S. society.  Explore contemporary governmental policies.  Analyze the role and influence of the U.S. in the world.  Study events, ideas, or movements that have influenced U.S. society.
