A Master of Science degree in Neuroscience is also attainable by physician residents in Psychiatry (see note on MS page). As a multidisciplinary program, students have numerous research opportunities in several departments across the campus. Fields of study cluster around three areas of concentration: neural signal transduction and molecular biology; systems and integrative neuroscience; and human/therapeutic neuroscience, cognition, and neural imaging.
