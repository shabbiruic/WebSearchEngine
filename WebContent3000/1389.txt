No questions will be asked, no proof is required, If you can play, you can play !     Non-Gendered Attire Policy  In an effort to be inclusive of all personal workout attire preferences, Campus Recreation has an open attire policy.  What does this mean in practice?   Beyond our facility policies , we do not require gender-specific attire within the Rec Center. Participants are encouraged to wear whatever attire honors their workout experience most, including sports bras, muscle tees, loose or tight-fitting clothing, etc.  Within the aquatic facility, patrons are asked to wear attire designed specifically for use in the water.     Personal Care Assistants  Personal Care Assistants (PCA) are eligible to access the Student Recreation Center in order to aid someone. The Personal Care Assistant will be required to sign a Campus Recreation Waiver and to email Jordan Offen in advance (joffen3@uic.edu). PCAs may access the Student Recreation Center only during times the individual needing assistance is in the facility, they should remain with the individual needing assistance, and can only assist the individual needing help (they cannot workout themselves). PCAs can attend various events and programs offered by Campus Recreation to assist those in need.    Staff Trainings  We offer a variety of training opportunities to our staff to further our commitment to providing welcoming customer service and programs.  What does this mean in practice?  Student and professional staff at Campus Recreation receive training on topics such as Inclusivity and Safe Zone Workshops.  We make inclusivity a priority, yet there may be times when someone (either on our own staff or a Campus Recreation user) may not be fully educated or aware of our policies. We make every effort to assure that you are always welcome within our building and at our programs, but if you have a concern, please let any of the staff on duty know, or you can contact Member Services at (312) 413-5162.
