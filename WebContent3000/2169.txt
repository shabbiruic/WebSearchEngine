The program allows students to become experts in understanding human well-being and development, with a special focus on individuals from diverse backgrounds and environments.  Whether you are interested in working with young children, adolescents, or adults, the BA in Human Development and Learning will prepare you for a career where you can guide people's growth and education.  Customize your major around your interests  With the help of our faculty and undergraduate advisors, HDL students customize their degree to their professional and personal goals and interests. HDL graduates work for nonprofits, health centers, day care centers, youth development programs, universities, museums, community organizations, and more. Some students focus their studies around a future career like social work, child care, social justice, and/or public health. Others continue their education in graduate programs.  Focus areas in HDL  Every HDL student chooses at least one focus area to guide their course of study.Â Focus areas can lead to credentials, a university minor, and/or prepare students for specific careers. Learn more on our focus areas and credentials page .      Tiffany Besana    Majoring in HDL was the best academic decision Iâve made! HDL is a great program for people who want to work with people because we explore how humans function cognitively and socioemotionally in diverse contexts from personable professors who are experts in their field and who genuinely care about our own learning and development as students.    Tiffany Besana | BA HDL, Class of 2019       Melvin Woolfolk    The HDL program has honed many of my abilities, making me a better student, leader, researcher, and overall human being. Everyone you meet is a resource for you, and you are a resource for everyone you meet!    Melvin J.
