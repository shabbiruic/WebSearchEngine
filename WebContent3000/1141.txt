Public art allows for a diversity of people to share their stories, concerns, andÂ desires; and theÂ LCCâs mural â ElÂ DespertarÂ deÂ lasÂ AmÃ©ricas Â (The Awakening of the Americas)âis a tool for doing this. These tours and dialogues are open to groups including UIC classes, high school students, and adult community members. Each program can be tailored to class topics or group interests as needed, and are available year-round. The following are options that you can choose from:   Migration and Immigration âÂ For groups as large as 25-30 participants, for 50, 75, or 90 minutes . Using art and storytelling, participants explore this contentious national issue, recognizing how it connectsÂ to each of us, from recent arrivals to long-time Chicagoans, expanding ourÂ understanding ofÂ different points of view.  Environmental &Â Climate Justice âÂ For groups as large as 25-30 participants for 50, 75, or 90 minutes . Using artifacts to symbolize cultural practices, participants explore diverse solutions to environmental and climate change challenges.  LCC Mural Tours âÂ For groups as large as 40 participants for 50 minutes . This program serves to introduce the LCC mural to visitors, intertwining artistic interpretation with historic tales of our campus community.        Desc   Seasonal Heritage Garden Tours  These tours areÂ offeredÂ June through October to groupsÂ including UIC classes, high school students, and adult community groups. Group coordinators must contact the LCC to reserve a tour.   TheÂ Heritage Garden Â is a hands-on learning project facilitated by the seven campus cultural centers (CCUSC), sponsored by the UIC Sustainability Fee. Join the student gardeners on this 50-minute exploration of the campusÂ satellite gardens, including the Monarch Habitat, to learn diverse cultural stories linking environmental and social justice issues. Participants will also explore theÂ Social & Environmental Pollinators Installation, a series of ten former ash urns painted by local Latinxs in Fall 2016 as part of the LCCâs 40th anniversary celebration.   Dialogue guides for museums, cultural centers, and historic sites  These guides have been created out of LCC initiatives in orderÂ to help inspire other cultural sites to address challenging contemporary issues with their communities through dialogue.

Tour/Dialogue Reservation Form       Watch and read how the LCC civic dialogues and tours support student learning and their college journey at UIC           Testimonials        âUS 130 students are now aware of LCC and the ECJ dialogues, they can connect course content materials in unique ways and also find personal connections to the dialogues, which research has shown has the greatest impact for change in attitudes, perspectives and behavior. Given the large class size (75 students) the smaller groups allow students to connect to students in the class that they may not otherwise communicate with during the semester.  We bring the LCC visit and ECJ dialogues up throughout the course time to make sure that the materials and learning objectives are reinforced and students gain additional insights from the ECJ dialogues with regard to the course materials. They are encouraged to bring their experiences up in class and during the online discussion days.  Overall, I highly recommend finding ways to integrate the ECJ dialogues in UIC course materials so that students get extra exposure to not only the content of the dialogues but also the amazing resource that LCC is for UIC studentsâ.
