The ArabAmCC organizes a graduation in the Spring semester that is open to Arab and Arab American students and others with connections and ties to the region and the Center. The graduation ceremony usually invites a keynote speaker and highlights several artistic productions in a night of celebration bringing parents, students, staff, faculty, and community together. In a political climate where Arab and Muslim Americans are demonized and targeted, celebrating our accomplishments and encouraging our students to keep contributing to our society and not be afraid to state who they are become even more important.
