Alford Director of Graduate Studies: Kamal Sharma  Program Codes:  20FS1024MS (MS) 20FS1024PHD (PhD)    The Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology offers work leading to degrees in Anatomy and Cell Biology. Applications are only accepted for doctoral level/PhD. The department does not accept applications for a master's degree. The MS is reserved only for internal candidates. The department also participates in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD joint degree program); see the Medical Scientist Training Program section for more information. Areas of study include neurobiology, cell biology, and developmental biology. There is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary studies that examine the relationship between structure and function. Research leading to a graduate degree is available in the following areas: neurobiology of the synapse, axonal transport, cytoskeleton, and response to stress; sensory systems; neuroplasticity; Alzheimerâs disease, Multiple Sclerosis and myelination, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and motor neuron disease, Huntingtonâs and Parkinsonâs disease, neuroblastoma, ion channel regulation, cell motility, connective tissue, neurotoxins and stem cell biology. The Interdepartmental Concentration in Neuroscience is available to doctoral students.
