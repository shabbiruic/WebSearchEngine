We invite you to apply and to be considered for this tuition award.

Must not have completed their degree requirements for graduation or already have earned a bachelorâs degree. Applicants must be continuing UIC undergraduate students who have attended UIC for at least one semester.  Must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and must qualify for Illinois resident tuition.  Must complete the FAFSA and have financial need as determined by the FAFSA.  Should have demonstrated both leadership and involvement in the movement against domestic violence and sexual assault throughout the UIC campus and/or Chicago community or have had personal experiences within these areas.   If you are interested in applying, please contact Dr. Natalie Bennett .  *Â This award can only be applied toward tuition costs, excluding fees.Â For out-of-state students, the maximum tuition award will only cover the amount equivalent to in-state tuition.Â  The student will be responsible for the remaining balance.       2019-2020 Tuition Award Recipients   We are pleased to announce the recipients of the 2019-2020 WLRC Tuition Award:  Helen Abera Senior Major: Sociology  Gurleen Kaur Junior Major: Computer Science Minor: Mathematics  Emoonah McClerklin Senior Major: Psychology and Sociology  Jeyra Rivera-Arocha Junior Major: Mechanical Engineering  Makiz Salehzai Sophomore Major: Teaching of English Minor: Psychology  Rashida Thompson Sophomore Major: Biological Sciences  Catherine Williams Junior Major: Civil Engineering          Resources              For DV/SA Survivors    Winter Break Emergency Info    Women-centered Campus Resources    Tuition Award    Reserve Our Space    Printed Resources                         Womenâs Leadership and Resource Center       Contact   1101 W.
