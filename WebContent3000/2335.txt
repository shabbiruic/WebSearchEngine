Our Rockford campus is part of the UIC Health Sciences Campus, home to the UIC College of Medicine and College of Nursing in Rockford.Â  Located on the banks of the Rock River, Rockford is the fourth largest city in Illinois and offers a small city feel for students who may prefer this.Â  The campus sits on 20 acres in a residential area of Rockford near the Rock River and nationally-recognizedÂ Anderson Japanese Gardens .Â Â The smaller class size in Rockford and interactions with the College of Medicine and College of Nursing students provide unique interprofessional education opportunities for our students. Pharmacy student organizations, professional fraternities, and clubs are all available to choose from as you develop into an excellent and caring pharmacist.  For students interested in practicing in a rural community upon graduation the Rockford Campus offers the Rural Pharmacy Education Program (RPHARM).Â  The goal of the RPHARM concentration is to educate students about the unique challenges and opportunities present in rural communities.Â  Approximately 20% of our current student population takes part in this concentration.Â  Upon graduation, students in the RPHARM Program are recognized as having completed a concentration in rural pharmacy services.Â  Over their four years in pharmacy school, RPHARM students work interprofessionally with medical and nursing students enrolled in the Rural Medical Education Program (RMED) and Rural Nursing Program (RNURSING).  The UIC College of Pharmacy at Chicago and Rockford offer students a top tier nationally ranked pharmacy education.Â  While a student on the Rockford campus, students will benefit from faculty who have an open-door policy and pride themselves on great student mentorship and guidance.Â  Rockfordâs small class size, close-knit student and faculty community, opportunities for interprofessional activities, and a lower cost of living are perfect for students considering a premier UIC College of Pharmacy education with these bonuses.
