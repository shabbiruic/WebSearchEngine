We’re excited to get the process started for you. Before we begin, we have a few questions.   Have you taken the PCAT Admission Test?  Do you have a PharmCAS profile?  Do you meet our admission requirements?   Those are the key building blocks in your admission process. If you’re ready to proceed, let’s get going!       Application Process   The UIC College of Pharmacy PharmD ProgramÂ uses aÂ rolling admissions process Â and does participate in theÂ PharmCAS Early Decision Program .Â  Regardless of which campus you would like to attend there is one application to UIC College of Pharmacy. Within the application you will be asked which campus you are applying to.Â  Applications are reviewed as they are received throughout the admissions cycle. For best consideration, apply as early as possible in the admissions cycle. Â Applications for all admissions pathways are administered through theÂ Pharmacy College Application Service Â (PharmCAS).  Questions regarding the application or the application process should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs, email –Â PharmD@uic.edu Â or by calling (312) 996-7242.      Complete and meet all admissions requirements         Part 1: Complete all pre-application requirements   Refer back to Admissions Requirements.        âEarly Decisionâ or âRegular Decisionâ         Part 2: Complete and submit a complete PharmCAS application   Determine if you are applying forÂ âEarly Decisionâ or âRegular Decisionâ. This will determine the application submission deadlines .  TheÂ PharmCAS Early Decision program Â is a great opportunity to apply to your top choice pharmacy program and has the benefit of having an early final admission decision. As a result, you can save time, money and stress by applying to your top choice school through the PharmCAS Early Decision program.  This is a binding option for applicants to your first choice and that will enroll if accepted. As an Early Decision applicant, you can apply to only one PharmD program. Those not admitted to the UIC College of Pharmacy may apply to other programs afterward through the Regular Decision process.    To be considered for Early Decision Â admission, Â you must meet the following criteria:   E-submit your PharmCAS application by September 3, 2019.  Submit and pay the PharmCAS application fee by September 3, 2019.  Send all your official transcripts so that they are received by PharmCAS by September 3, 2019.  Submit PCAT scores to PharmCAS (taken within the last 2 years). Â We will accept the September PCAT. Â However, if you take the September PCAT, email your unofficial score report toÂ pharmd@uic.eduÂ because scores might not be updated in PharmCAS in time for consideration during the Early Decision period.   Important Notes   Your transcripts do not need to be verified by September 3, 2019.  Your Official PCAT results and letters of recommendation do not need to be submitted by September 3, 2019.  If your application, transcripts, or fee arrive after the deadline, PharmCAS will automatically change your file from early decision status to regular status.  If you wish to apply to more than one Pharmacy program, then we encourage you to apply early through the regular application process.   If you are an Out-of-State applicant, UIC College of Pharmacy will honor all applications received and processed through the PharmCAS Early Decision deadline and timeline to receive the In-State Student Tuition Award, but you do not need to be an official PharmCAS Early Decision designated applicant to secure In-state tuition for either the Chicago or Rockford campus.        Complete and e-submit a PharmCAS Application         Part 3: Complete the UIC College of Pharmacy Supplemental Application    Provide all information and complete all questions required by PharmCAS as well as the UIC College of Pharmacy specific questions located in the Program Materials section of the PharmCAS application, it is here where the campus selection question, Chicago or Rockford, will appear.  Submit up-to-date official transcripts from all institutions attended. If you have foreign coursework, please submit a WES evaluation.  Match your coursework to the UIC College of Pharmacy prerequisite requirements in the Program Materials section of the PharmCAS application. Courses may not be listed in multiple prerequisite areas.  *List the names of at least two recommenders (one academic and one supervisor).  *Enter your PCAT information (date(s) of exams, PCAT CID). Must be no more than two years old.  E-submit the PharmCAS application no later than the UIC College of Pharmacy PharmCAS deadline (see deadlines). Ensure all fees are paid.Â  If fees are not paid, PharmCAS will not verify your application.   *PCAT scores and letters from your recommenders are not required for e-submission and for PharmCAS to verify your application.Â  If that information is not available when your PharmCAS application is e-submitted, the UIC College of Pharmacy will review your application when the information becomes available.        Complete the UIC PharmD Supplemental Application (by invitation)         Part 4: Complete an on-site interview   When your verified PharmCAS application is received by the UIC College of Pharmacy, your:   prerequisite coursework is verified (to determine if all prerequisites will be completed by the end of the spring semester) and  GPAs (cumulative, combined science/math coursework, and prerequisite coursework) are verified to ensure a 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher   Applicants who meet these two conditions will be invited to complete the UIC PharmD Supplemental Application.Â  If the prerequisite coursework cannot be fully verified or the GPA requirement is not met, the applicants will receive a follow-up email.        Admissions Committee Holistic Review         Part 5: If successfully admitted, pay the acceptance deposit   Applicants who have completed the UIC PharmD Supplemental Application and have the required letters of recommendation and PCAT scores in PharmCAS will have their application materials reviewed by the Admissions Committee.  Applicants receive a status update when the admissions review is completed.        Complete Preferred Campus Admissions Visit         Complete Preferred Campus Admissions Visit   After a holistic review by the Admissions Committee, a select number of highly qualified applicants will be invited to complete a half-day, on-site admissions visit.Â  The visit to the preferred campus consists of information sessions with student panels and faculty, on-site MMI interviews, and a writing assessment.        Admissions Decision         Admissions Decision   Applicants receive a status update after the campus admissions visit.Â  Applicants offered admission must pay the required admission deposit(s) by the specified Admission Deposit Deadlines if they wish to accept the offer.Â  If the acceptance deposit is not received by the specified deadline, the admission offer is withdrawn.  Because the UIC College of Pharmacy participates in the Cooperative Admissions Guidelines (CAG), we expect applicants to adhere to the following Applicant Acceptance Protocols.Â  These protocols do not apply to Early Decision applicants.  Prior to March 1   In fairness to other applicants and pharmacy programs, if you have decided before March 1 not to attend a pharmacy school or college that has offered you admission, promptly withdraw your application from that (those) program(s) using the school or collegeâs preferred method.  You may choose to hold multiple acceptances until March 1.  When a school or college extends an offer of admission prior to March 1, a maximum $200 holding deposit may be required.  Schools and colleges may not require a second deposit prior to March 1. After March 1 they will set the dollar value for the second deposit, if applicable.   After March 1   After March 1, you may hold only a single acceptance.  If you have accepted an admissions offer from more than one school, you must choose the school at which you will enroll by March 1.  By March 1, promptly withdraw your application from all other schools that offered you an acceptance using the school or collegeâs preferred method.  Additional admission offers may continue as needed after March 1.  If you receive and choose to accept an offer after March 1, you must rescind your acceptance at the school where you had previously accepted an offer prior to accepting the offer at the new school.         Admission Deposit Deadlines         Admission Deposit Deadlines   If an applicant accepts an admission offer, the admission deposit(s) must be paid by the following deadlines:  Early Decision Admission Offer Full acceptance deposit ($1000) â due two weeks after offer  Regular Admission Offer – before March 1, 2019 Initial acceptance deposit ($200) â due two weeks after offer Final acceptance deposit ($800) â due March 1, 2019  Regular Admission Offer – after March 1, 2019 Full acceptance deposit ($1000) â due two weeks after offer  Admission deposits are not refundable for any reason.
