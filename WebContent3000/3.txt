The College of Engineering supports many student organizations, which organize events for professional development and networking that you can’t do in a classroom setting. After graduation, I plan to use both my CS major and social justice minor to work in civic tech in Chicago and make a meaningful difference in my communities.”    Erick Vaquero | BS in Computer Science             Undergraduate              Admitted Students    Admissions    Accreditation    CS Major    CS Minor    Courses    Internships and Jobs    Student Groups    Student Profiles    Student Resources    Women in CS                           College of  Engineering           Footer Menu    Undergraduate Resources    Graduate Resources    Faculty Resources    ABET Accreditation         Contact   For CS student and faculty inquiries, contact:  851 S.
