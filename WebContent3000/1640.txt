International Travel Insurance Requirements   All UIC students on university-authorized travel abroad and UIC employees traveling with them must enroll in the International Travel Safety roster and obtain the University of Illinois Systemâs comprehensive insurance plan through the ITS roster.  Other UIC faculty or staff on university-authorized business, but not traveling with students, are strongly encouraged to enroll and to obtain the comprehensive insurance.  This policy doesÂ notÂ cover faculty, staff, or studentsâ personal travel that isÂ unrelatedÂ to work or academic duties at UIC.  Insurance for graduate students and faculty required under university policy is a reimbursable expense and should be included in travel-related budgets.  Faculty should consult with Alma Sias before enrolling on the roster and obtaining travel insurance under this policy.
