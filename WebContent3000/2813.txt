Download this 2017 presentation by the DMC .Â          Data Management Core    Regardless of your field of study or specific research interests, skillful data management is essential for maintaining research rigor and integrity, using resources efficiently (expenditures and personnel time), and advancing the state of science in your field through replication and sharing of research data.  The Data Management Core at the Institute for Health Research and Policy provides consultation and services to UIC scientists throughout the lifespan of their research projects.  During the grant-writing phase, our Core offers assistance by developing a data management plan for your proposal, helping you to plan strategies and approaches, and providing budget estimates relating to data collection and processing activities. Once your project is funded, we provide recommendations on collecting, documenting, organizing, storing, sharing, and archiving your research data.  The Core also offers a range of specific data management services, including research protocol development, web-based survey development, data entry and processing, staff training for your research projects, and assistance preparing your data for archiving.  An initial, one-hour consultation with the IHRP Data Management Core is free of charge for any UIC researcher.  After that discussion, an hourly rate is charged. For data management services, a detailed work scope and budget are developed based on the specific needs of your project.  If you are budgeting our services into a grant proposal, there is no charge for the related grant planning and writing activities.  To learn more, or to schedule a consultation appointment, contact the Core's director, Kathleen Diviak, PhD, at kdiviak@uic.edu .
