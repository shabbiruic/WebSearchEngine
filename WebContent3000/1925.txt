Academic Concerns   Students are encouraged to contact their professors to seek advice about any academic concerns. If a student is unable to resolve an issue or complaint with the professor, the student shouldÂ send a written complaint to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs . You may send your complaint via email or typed letter. Examples of complaints addressed by this process include, but are not limited to,Â grade disputes , academic standing issues, and disputes with professors. These proceduresÂ do not Â apply to decisions made under the Student Code of Conduct.       Complaints Involving the Student Code of Conduct   Any member of the faculty, administration, staff, or student body may initiate a discipline proceeding against a student or former student by filing a charge with the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs. The charge shall identify the parties involved in the complaint and state in plain language and with reasonable particularity the date, place, and relevant facts. If possible, the student should also identify the standard of conduct which has been violated. This charge can be sent via email or typed letter.  The Student Code of Conduct is available on theÂ Institutional Policies Â page.       Complaints Related to the Protection from Discrimination & Harassment Policy   UIC does not tolerate discrimination in admissions,Â employment,Â access to andÂ treatmentÂ in UniversityÂ programsÂ and activities. Unlawful discrimination, bias, and harassment can consist of words or conduct. Although freedom of expression is vitalÂ to the educational process, it does not excuse unlawful discrimination, bias, and harassmentÂ targeted at specific persons or groups.This policy applies to all aspects of employment and the educational environment including educational programs, services,Â and extracurricular activities. For more information, please see theÂ UIC John Marshall Law School Nondiscrimination Policy .Â If you believe you have been subjected to unlawful discrimination, bias, or harassment of any kind, please report it.  Any student, employee, or faculty member may submit a complaint or report of alleged discrimination orÂ harassment by:   Calling Ethics Line, the Universityâs confidential reporting line, at (866) 758-2146;  Contacting one of the resources listed on the Universityâs Office for Access and Equity website ;  Completing the online Discrimination/Bias Incident Reporting Form ;  Contacting the Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion , any dean or faculty member.        Complaints Related to the Protection from Sexual Harassment & Sexual Misconduct Policy   UIC does not tolerate sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or other sexual misconduct of any kind (including sexual assault, sexual violence, or sexual abuse) against faculty, staff, or students. Prohibited behaviors can be words or conduct. Examples of prohibited verbal behaviors include, but are not limited to, unwelcome sexual innuendo, gender stereotyping, sexual propositions, and comments, insults, threats, and jokes about gender-specific traits including when communicated through electronic media. For more information, please see UIC’s Sexual Misconduct Policy If you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment of any kind, please report it. Any student, employee, or faculty member may submit a complaint or report of alleged sexual harassment or misconduct by:   Calling Ethics Line, the Universityâs confidential reporting line, at (866) 758-2146;  Contacting one of the resources listed on the Universityâs Office for Access and Equity website ;  Completing the online Sexual Harassment Reporting Form ;  Contacting any dean or faculty member.   All employees are considered to be âResponsible Employeesâ with the authority and responsibility to report sexual misconduct. Thus, any employee who knows or has reason to believe that a violation of this policy has occurred has an obligation to report the matter whether or not the victim has made a formal complaint.       Protection Against Retaliation   We encourage you to report.Â UIC does not tolerate retaliation. Any person who retaliates against someone who makes or participates in an investigation will face appropriate disciplinary action up to andÂ including suspension, employee termination, or student dismissal. Any form of retaliationÂ should be promptly reported immediately to the Office of Access and Equity.       Complaints to the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association   UIC John Marshall Law School is accredited by the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association. Any student with complaints, questions, or concerns that directly implicate the Law Schoolâs compliance with the ABAâs Accreditation Standards can file a complaint using theÂ Student Complaints â Compliance with ABA Accreditation Standards Form . Your complaint must identify the specific ABA Accreditation Standard at issue. TheÂ ABA standards can be reviewed online .

Complaints to The Higher Learning Commission   UIC John Marshall Law School is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission. The Higher Learning Commission has established a clear distinction between individual grievances and complaints that appear to involve broad institutional practices. Where a complaint to the HLC raises issues regarding the institutionâs ongoing ability to meet theÂ Criteria of Accreditation , the Commission forwards the complaint to the institution and requests a formal response.  The Higher Learning Commission 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500 Chicago, Illinois 60604-1411       Complaint Procedure for Online Students   Illinois is a member of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), an agreement that establishes standards for postsecondary distance education among member states. Each SARA state designates a state agency to serve as the stateâs portal agency, the point of contact for SARA questions, complaints and other communications. The Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) acts as the SARA portal agency for Illinois.  As a participant in SARA, UIC John Marshall Law School follows theÂ SARA Student Complaint Resolution Process Â in addressing the complaints of distance education students from SARA member states (see below). If unsatisfied with the outcome of the law schoolâs internal complaint process, a student may appeal to the IBHE through itsÂ online complaint system . Disputes regarding grades and student conduct violations fall outside the SARA complaint process and are governed entirely by the law schoolâs policy and Illinois law.  SARA Member States: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming  Distance education students from states that are not members of SARA are encouraged to seek resolution of complaints through the law schoolâs internal complaint processes.
