And most see little to no added cost over what they pay in a normal semester. Students can choose language intensive programs, ones offering credit towards a variety of majors from psychology to engineering, or programs that are great options to fulfill general education requirements.

When I moved to Paris, it turns out I was on line at a stop we had studied a lot (in FR 297) so it was really kind of a full circle experience of taking this course and it wasnât what I thought it was going to be but I ended up enjoying it and learning a lot about different groups in Paris. And then when I moved there I was right by the heart of all those different groups and in different cultures and it was all around me.    Bradley G.
