They assist you in outlining the specific requirements for your major, key course sequencing, mapping out plans for completing these requirements, and general information about related career options.Â They are also available to help you get involved in internships, undergraduate research, and independent studies related to your major, in addition to additional exciting opportunities, such as: student organization and study abroad. Appointment and drop-in advising times vary.  Because departmental advisors focus more specifically on major requirements, you are still expected to maintain contact with your LAS assigned advisor regarding your academic progress and for a thorough Degree Audit review of LAS degree requirements.  LAS students must meet with a departmental academic advisor to declare their major. All UIC undergraduate students, regardless of home college, who wish to declare an LAS minor may complete the Request to Add/Update LAS Minor Form below.
