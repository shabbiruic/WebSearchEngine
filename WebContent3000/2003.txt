What specific services do you offer to students?   Our office provides a wide range of services to students. First, we try to make students aware of the nationally- and internationally-competitive awards that are available, and we provide information about eligibility for these awards. Secondly, we provide extensive support to students as they work through the application process. We accomplish this goal by helping students write and revise the required written materials for applications (personal statements, project outlines, etc.), develop their resumes, and put together the most professional, and competitive, application possible. One part of this process is providing students with logistical support as well, such as obtaining transcripts, sending materials, and providing other clerical resources.  **While any student is welcome to use our website in their national fellowships search, the services we provide are only available to alumni or students who are currently enrolled at The University of Illinois at Chicago.**             2     What national scholarship related resources are available for student use?         What national scholarship related resources are available for student use?   Students are always welcome to talk with OEF staff to discuss external fellowships and scholarships. The Director has much experience partnering with the foundations that grant these fellowships, and that experience will help her advise you about which opportunities are a good fit for you, and how you can put together the best possible application for a particular award.             3     Can all UIC students come to the Office of External Fellowships?         Can all UIC students come to the Office of External Fellowships?   OEF serves all UIC undergraduate students and recent alumni. OEF may serve graduate students whose programs are not part of the Graduate College.  For students in the Graduate College , please contact Fellowships and Awards Coordinator, Benn Williams: bwilli7@uic.edu.             4     When should students come to OEF?         When should students come to OEF?   Students should come whenever they are ready to investigate the external fellowship and scholarship opportunities that are available to them. It’s never too early to start!  Many fellowship applications have a long lead time, so that you need to be writing and preparing weeks, or even months, in advance of the due date. OEF is here to walk you through the entire process.  For many scholarships, you may need to position yourself by gaining key co-curricular experiences, like research and internships, over many semesters, including the summers. OEF can advise you about those too!             5     How do I make an appointment?         How do I make an appointment?   The first step is to complete the Student Information Form . Once we receive your information, we will follow up with you to schedule an appointment.  If you have already met with staff at OEF and would like to meet again, please email oef@uic.edu .             6     Where is OEF located?         Where is OEF located?   The Office of External Fellowships is located in room 802 of the University Hall Building (UH). University Hall is located on the East Campus of UIC on Harrison Street, just off the intersection with Morgan Street.             7     What are the office hours?         What are the office hours?   Generally, OEF is open 9:00am-5:00pm, Monday through Friday. The office is open year-round, including during the summer.  It is best to make an appointment if you would like an opportunity to meet with someone one-on-one, or to sign up for an information session if you would like general questions covered in a more conversational setting with other students.             8     What kinds of awards does OEF work with?         What kinds of awards does OEF work with?   The Office ofÂ External Fellowships focuses most of our time and energy on a select group of nationally competitive awardsÂ ( see Fellowships page ). This focus is due largely to the fact that many of the organizations that bestow these awards require a formal nomination or endorsement from UIC. This means that you don’t apply directly by yourself but rather get nominated by UIC, and OEF coordinates this process.  In addition, OEF seeks to help students locate other awards sponsored by organizations outside of UIC, including those that provide funding for graduate and professional school, study abroad, or undergraduate education.             9     What does 'nationally competitive' or 'internationally competitive' mean?         What does 'nationally competitive' or 'internationally competitive' mean?   When we say that an award is ‘nationally competitive’ we mean that applicants from all across the United States are applying for the award. Similarly, an ‘internationally competitive’ award is open to students from around the world. Not surprisingly, this means there is a higher level of competitiveness as compared to awards that may be sponsored by local entities, such as the State of Illinois or a Chicago-based organization. In addition, these awards are generally viewed as the hardest to win, and therefore may require a substantial amount of preparatory work. While many perceive that these awards generally go to students attending elite private institutions, that is far from the whole story. UIC and many other state universities have candidates who win these prestigious awards on a regular basis, and we know that there are UIC students every year who are capable of winning them. Please see ourÂ Recent Recipients page Â for recent award recipients from UIC.             10     Is there a particular deadline to be eligible for fellowships?         Is there a particular deadline to be eligible for scholarships?   Because our office works with a variety of fellowships, each with their own application timeline, there is no single deadline that students must meet. The golden rule is: It’s never too early to start!  For example, the end of the spring semester and early summer is an excellent time to come to OEF for advice and help with awards that have fall deadlines, such as the Fulbright, Rhodes, or Marshall. Students should not wait until just prior to the deadline when they, and many others, are likely to need assistance.             11     Which honor societies should I join? Are all honor societies legitimate?         Which honor societies should I join? Are all honor societies legitimate?   As a student with strong grades, you will likely be invited to join honor societies. Most of them are legitimate organizations, but from time to time we hear about suspicious organizations offering membership for a fee that turns out to be simply scams. Honor societies with an established history at UIC have access to your overall GPA but those outside the university do not. UIC sponsored honor societies areÂ listed on this Honors College page .   Joining an honor society may help affirm to others that you are a student in good standing; it may offer you the chance to apply for scholarships offered by the society and, if it is an honor society in your major, it may offer useful advice about the field you are going into and career-specific awards.  As a general rule, you do not look better to a graduate program, employer or scholarship competition if you are in 5 honor societies as opposed to one or two. In choosing what groups to join, consider how much they are asking you to pay and what you get from the payment. (A newsletter? A pin? An induction ceremony? The chance to compete for scholarships? Prestige?) You may also want to ask faculty and staff if the organization is well-recognized and well-respected. If the name of the honor society is unfamiliar, consider the advice onÂ this website Â in evaluating whether to join:  You can also check theÂ UIC Undergraduate Catalog Â for an understanding of what graduating with honors means.              12     Where do I find scholarships?         Where do I find scholarships?   Scholarships are offered through the university and from outside sources for incoming students, continuing students, graduating seniors, and sometimes alumni. High school students applying to UIC only need to apply to the university and the designated special programs they are interested in (e.g. Honors College, GPPA, Business Scholars) to be considered for ALL scholarships available to incoming freshmen.  Continuing students can apply for UIC-based scholarships throughÂ UIC SnAP . Students can find external scholarships on theÂ UIC Scholarships Â site.  For assistance withÂ scholarships and financial aid , please contact Director of Scholarships, Kara Holloway: khollowa@uic.edu .             13     What is UIC SNAP?         What is UIC SNAP?   The UIC Scholarship and Awards Program orÂ UIC SnAP Â is UICâs portal for continuing students to apply for scholarships. If you are an undergraduate, graduate student or professional program student you are likely to find scholarships in the system that will fit you. Most UIC scholarships are live in the system in spring and the funds apply to your account the following fall. Some awards require you to write essays and submit a resume. Others may request references or other supporting material. A variety of awards are available year-round. Use your UIC account to log intoÂ uic.academicworks.com Â to apply.                                Office of External Fellowships          Contact   601 S.
