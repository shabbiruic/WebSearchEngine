PDFBooklet  Have you ever tried printing a long document 2-up and double sided, so that 4 pages fit on one sheet of paper? We do this a lot, and it's always confusing and annoying to turn the pages. This little OS X application pads and reorders the pages to turn the unwieldy paper into a neat little booklet. Print the result with '2 pages per sheet' and 'short edge binding', fold it in the middle and put a staple at the 'binding' and you're done. To install, download and unpack this archive (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and up only) and pull the PDFBooklet to your applications folder.  If you would like the source code, please contact jakob@uic.edu : the sources are free as well, but you have to ask for them          Attachments   Attachments     Topic attachments    I    Attachment    Action    Size    Date    Who    Comment      zip    PDFBooklet.zip    manage   29.2 K   2010-07-04 - 01:43    UnknownUser        gz    gis12_mapinference.tar.gz    manage   1972.2 K   2012-11-08 - 00:10    UnknownUser        zip    uic_ground_truth_map.zip    manage   683.9 K   2011-11-29 - 17:18    UnknownUser              BITS Front Page    Software and Traces    Internal    Documentation    Members Only    Templates     Log In                              ABOUT US   Our Department  Recent News  Contact Us       ACADEMICS   Prospective Students  Undergraduate  CS Minor  Graduate  Courses       RESEARCH   Overview  By Faculty  Labs       PEOPLE   Faculty  Adjuncts  Staff  Students  Alumni        Copyright 2016 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. webmaster@cs.uic.edu  WISEST Helping Women Faculty Advance Funded by NSF
