Photo: Jenny Fontaine           Susan Magasi imagines a world where everyone has equal access to quality health care, including people with disabilities. Magasi, assistant professor of occupational therapy, is doing her best to make that happen. For her accomplishments and the promise of future achievement, she was recently named a UIC Rising Star Researcher of the Year.  âIn an ideal world, there would be no need for my field of research, because everyone would have access to quality care,â Magasi says.  She conducts community-engaged participatory research, partnering with organizations in the disability community. âWe hold each other accountable to make sure we are responsive to the community, not imposing outside solutions on people with disabilities,â she explains.  Since joining UIC in 2013, Magasi has been principal investigator on five grants from organizations that include the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society and National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research.  Her current research began with focus groups that identified barriers to health care for people with disabilities, both physical (like exam equipment that canât be adjusted for people in wheelchairs) and attitudinal (such as clinicians who assume people with disabilities canât make their own health care decisions).  The next step: using peer support to develop tools for overcoming these barriers.  âWeâve tried to develop interventions that build off the strengths of the disability community,â Magasi says. âPeer support has always been at the heart of the disability rights movement.â  With a five-year, $730,000 grant from the NIDILRR, Magasi is developing a peer health navigator program in partnership with Access Living, a Center for independent Living, and Community Care Alliance of Illinois, a Medicaid managed care provider. The goal is to create a model for navigator programs that can be used in other settings.  In the pilot study, eight people of various ages and disabilities were trained as peer health navigators. They are working with 20 patients, to help people break down barriers to care through a structured process of goal setting, barrier identification and action planning and help make sure that people get the care they need.  Next fall, the project will expand to a clinical trial with 120 patients.  âAlready, weâre chipping away at health care disparities,â Magasi says.  For example, one man had trouble getting his wheelchair repaired. A peer navigator helped him break down the process into steps to get the repairs done.  âSomething really special is happening with the navigators, too â a sense of empowerment,â Magasi says.  Last fall, Magasi put her research into action with ScreenABLE Saturday, a community health event in partnership with the Chicago Cancer Health Equality Collaboration that included free accessible mammograms to disabled women.  âFor many of the women who attended, it was the first time they had had a mammogram,â Magasi says.  âThis was an exciting project because it allowed us to take what we know from research and translate that into direct community impact.â          Occupational Therapy              Admissions and Programs             MS in Occupational Therapy             What to Expect             Student Leadership      Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply             Checklist for Admitted Students      FAQs    Fieldwork    Graduation and Credentialing      Doctor of Occupational Therapy             What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Faculty Advisors      Co-enrolling in the MS and OTD programs      Occupational Therapy Faculty Practice             Children, Youth and Families    Self-Management      Research and Scholarship    News    Calendar    Directory    Contact              Follow Occupational Therapy                              College of  Applied Health  Sciences                                  Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts                                              UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
