The students conducted a training program for about 300 home health care aides at the Chinese American Service League. They taught the aides body mechanics and safe functional transfer techniques to use in caring for elderly patients.  Faculty members Jenica Lee, occupational therapy, and Tanvi Bhatt, physical therapy, organized the group of nine PT and 10 OT students who conducted the training.  âIt was a great collaboration and wonderful opportunity for both OT and PT students to apply their skills outside of the classroom, as well as to engage with the Chinese community,â says Lee. âAnd weâve already been invited to do it again next year.”         Physical Therapy              Admissions and Programs             Doctor of Physical Therapy             What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply    Accepted Applicants      MS in Healthspan Promotion and Rehabilitation             What to Expect    Before You Apply    Applying    After You Apply      Certificate in Clinical Rehabilitation and Technology Research             What to Expect      Healthy Living Practitionerâ¢ Certificate             What to Expect    Applying      Technology-Based Health Communication and Promotion Certificate             What to Expect    Applying      Residency in Orthopedic Physical Therapy             Applying    Resident Accomplishments      Residency in Sports Physical Therapy             Applying    Resident Accomplishments        PT Faculty Practice    Continuing Education    News    Calendar    Directory    Contact              Follow Physical Therapy                              College of  Applied Health  Sciences                                  Quick Links    Calendar    Directory    News    Inside AHS    Graduation      Resources    Academic Support and Achievement Program    Student Resources    Faculty and Staff Resources    Academic Calendar      Tools    myUIC    GoogleApps@UIC    Webmail    Blackboard    Nessie        Connect with AHS    Contact us    Apply Now    Give to AHS         1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612  312-996-6695  ahsinfo@uic.edu    Social Media Accounts                                              UIC.edu links   UIC.edu  Academic Calendar  Athletics  Campus Directory  Disability Resources  Emergency Information  Event Calendar  Job Openings  Library  Maps  UIC News  UI Health  Veterans Affairs        © 2020 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |  Privacy Statement    Campuses   University of Illinois System  Urbana-Champaign  Springfield
