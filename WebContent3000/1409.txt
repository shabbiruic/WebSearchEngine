FAQ   First Massage Experience  If this is your first massage session, your massage therapist will explain the procedures, techniques, and discuss your expectations for your massage session. We want you to be as comfortable as possible. Feel free to ask any questions to your therapist before or during your session. Here are some FAQâs.  What do I wear?  When you enter the massage room, your therapist will talk to you about any specifics for your massage and then leave the room for you to get undressed. You can undress to your level of comfort. You will lie underneath the top sheet. As your massage therapist works on you, he/she will expose only the area that will be worked on.  Can I work out before my massage?  Yes, you can. But, please allow 30 minutes for your body to relax and get back to normal blood pressure and pulse. PleaseÂ SHOWERÂ before your massage if you do workout. Not only for sanitary reasons, but also our lotion will not allow a smooth glide with certain techniques.  Can I work out after my massage?  Yes and No. Depending on the type of massage you received and how long it was. The deeper the work and the longer your session, your body needs recovery time. If you had a long, relaxing session, your body will not feel like doing anything but relaxing.  Do I have to talk during the session?  The main communication that needs to happen during your massage is for your comfort level, if you need more or less pressure, and/or if you experience pain in certain areas. General conversation during your massage is not necessary; you can talk as much as you would like or not at all.  Do I have to drink water after my massage?  It is important to replenish your bodyâs muscles with water. You donât have to drink extra, unless youâre already dehydrated.  Should I keep my appointment if I start feeling sick?  No. If you start feeling sick, please call the office to cancel/reschedule your appointment. Massage may increase your symptoms and you may feel worse after your session.
