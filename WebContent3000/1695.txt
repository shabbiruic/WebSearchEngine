I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad.Â  I came to UIC for my graduate education because it is one of a few institutions in the nation that actually have someone working in my specific field of interest â Set Theory.Â  I was encouraged to go here by a U of C professor. The other thing that attracted me to UIC was the research faculty here.  My long term goal is to become a Mathematician Scientist. I want to continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge that my intellectual predecessors have. I also want to continue studying computer programs and systems.Â Â General advice to new students:Â forge your own community on campus.Â  Become study buddies with and bounce ideas off of others outside of your own major. Thatâs how you learn and grow. Just remember to keep an open mind to othersâ opinions.
