About “Visiting” Positions  In a grant-supported environment such as IHRP, some full-time non-faculty positions are designated "visiting" positions. Visiting positions are eligible for the University's full benefits package, but are for designated periods of employment. Frequently, an IHRP position is funded by a specific federal grant, and may last up to five years, or the full term of the grant, depending on the role. Because they are temporary, these positions do not require a formal search process.
