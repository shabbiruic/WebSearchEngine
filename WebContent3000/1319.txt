All students should contact the MS CTS Program Coordinator who will explain the application process for MS CTS admission.  For students applying to both programs simultaneously, MS CTS admission will be contingent upon both admission to the PharmD program and the support of the associate dean for student affairs in the College of Pharmacy. Prior to admitting students into the MS CTS degree, HPA will check with the COP to determine whether the student has been accepted into the PharmD program, and to be sure that the applicant has a prior baccalaureate degree or has completed both the P1 and P2 years satisfactorily.  Admission to the MS CTS program will be determined based on the support of the associate dean for student affairs in the COP, a baccalaureate degree (or successful completion of P1 and P2), previous academic achievement, research potential, and commitment to CTS as evidenced by prior participation in clinical research.  In addition to other application materials, joint degree applicants are also expected to submit the following:  Letters of Recommendation Two required, one of which must be from a suitable clinical researcher who can attest to the applicantâs research abilities. Both letters of recommendation should address:  the applicantâs previous achievements in research and/or academics;  the applicantâs potential for successfully completing a clinical/translational research project;  analysis of the applicantâs career plans and commitment to research, and  how the joint degree would advance these plans.    Personal Statement Applicants will also submit a personal statement detailing accomplishments to date, and career goals and plans. Specifically, applicants should address background information relevant to their interest in clinical and translational research, and how additional training through the PharmD/MS CTS program would help achieve these goals. The applicant should provide any prior or ongoing research experience and explain how this might interface with the joint degree program.   Degree Requirements  In addition to the Graduate College minimum requirements, students must meet the following program requirements:   Students in the program must satisfy the requirements of the MS CTS program and the PharmD Program.  For the MS CTS program, students must adhere to all relevant policies of the Graduate College, including minimum GPA and limits on transfer credit.
